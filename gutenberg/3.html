            <a name="pref01"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

        <p>
            Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very gradual character of our education, we must continually
            forget, and emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to acquire.
        </p>

        <p>
            And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu of their conventional value. The same principles
            which have swept away traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The credulity
            of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures
            in the Church. History and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent times, are subjected to very different handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere statements are jealously watched,
            and the motives of the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his history, as the facts he records. Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this troublesome standard that a large portion of historical
            evidence is sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its demands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of extended experience, is the best help to the criticism
            of human history. Historical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a great whole—we
            must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we must rather consider the general bearing of the
            whole narrative, than the respective probability of its details.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere<a href="#fn1" name="fnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> have, perhaps, contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of
            mankind than any other three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will follow. The
            personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon everything else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or less of doubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates
            we know as little as the contradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one of the <i>dramatis personæ</i> in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style. He appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their
            tone as those of the writers who have handed them down. When we have read Plato <i>or</i> Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates; when we have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are something worse than ignorant.
        </p>

        <p>
            It has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were too much for our belief. This system—which has often comforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the
            consolations of Strauss for those of the New Testament—has been of incalculable value to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries. To question the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more excusable act, than to believe
            in that of Romulus. To deny a fact related in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory developed from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured old
            king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized—<i>Numa Pompilius.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer, and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all written tradition, concerning the author or authors
            of the Iliad and Odyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. “This cannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not true, because it cannot be true.”
            Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and oblivion.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which truth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of the Homeric theory in its present conditions,
            some notice must be taken of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to Herodotus.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to this document, the city of Cumæ in Æolia, was, at an early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of Greece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes. Although poor, he married, and the result of the
            union was a girl named Critheïs. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we “are indebted for so much happiness.” Homer was the first fruit of
            her juvenile frailty, and received the name of Melesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles, in Bœotia, whither Critheïs had been transported in order to save her reputation.
        </p>

        <p>
            “At this time,” continues our narrative, “there lived at Smyrna a man named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being married, engaged Critheïs to manage his household, and spin the flax he received as the price of his scholastic labours.
            So satisfactory was her performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement, willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man, if he were
            carefully brought up.”
        </p>

        <p>
            They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius died, leaving him sole heir to his property,
            and his mother soon followed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father’s school with great success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna, but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially in the
            exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times, persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany
            him on his travels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him with a further stipend, urging, that, “While he was yet young, it was fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities which might hereafter
            be the subjects of his discourses.” Melesigenes consented, and set out with his patron, “examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met.” We may also suppose,
            that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation.
            <a href="#fn2" name="fnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here Melesigenes, who had already suffered in his eyes, became much worse, and Mentes, who was about to leave for Leucadia, left
            him to the medical superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of Alcinor. Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed the subject
            of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans make their city the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he applied himself to the study of poetry.
            <a href="#fn3" name="fnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            But poverty soon drove him to Cumæ. Having passed over the Hermæan plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumæ. Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one Tychias, an armourer. “And up to my time,”
            continued the author, “the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes arrived”.
            <a href="#fn4" name="fnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph on Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater probability, been attributed to Cleobulus of
            Lindus.
            <a href="#fn5" name="fnref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Arrived at Cumæ, he frequented the <i>converzationes</i><a href="#fn6" name="fnref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> of the old men, and delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this favourable reception, he declared that, if they would
            allow him a public maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously renowned. They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed, and procured him an audience in the council. Having made the speech, with the purport
            of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal.
        </p>

        <p>
            The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet’s demand, but one man observed that “if they were to feed <i>Homers</i>, they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.” “From this circumstance,” says the writer,
            “Melesigenes acquired the name of Homer, for the Cumans call blind men <i>Homers</i>.”<a href="#fn7" name="fnref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> With a love of economy, which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men,
            the pension was denied, and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that Cumæa might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Phocœa, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress. One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept Homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the verses of the poet passing in his name.
            Having collected sufficient poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him. At his departure, Homer is said to have observed: “O Thestorides, of the
            many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more unintelligible than the human heart.”<a href="#fn8" name="fnref8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the very
            same poems. This at once determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be setting sail thither, but he found one ready to start for Erythræ, a town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow
            him to accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Erythræ, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in Phocœa, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty, reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure, which we will continue in the words of our author.
            “Having set out from Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus (for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up quickly, called
            off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a place alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then went up to him, and inquired who he was, and how he had
            come to desolate places and untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion; and he took him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade him
            sup.
            <a href="#fn9" name="fnref9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            “The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according to their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O Glaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs their supper at the doors of the hut: for so it
            is better, since, whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.
        </p>

        <p>
            Glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author. Having finished supper, they banqueted<a href="#fn10" name="fnref10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> afresh on conversation, Homer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he
            had visited.
        </p>

        <p>
            At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with Homer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left Homer at home, promising to return quickly.
            Having arrived at Bolissus, a place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole story respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to what he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding
            maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the stranger to him.
        </p>

        <p>
            Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him, assuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain,
            and to undertake the charge of his children.<a href="#fn11" name="fnref11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the island, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of Chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry. “To this day,” says Chandler,
            <a href="#fn12" name="fnref12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> “the most curious remaining is that which has been named, without reason, the School of Homer. It is on the coast, at some distance from the city, northward, and appears to have been an open
            temple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock. The shape is oval, and in the centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an arm wanting. She is represented, as usual, sitting. The chair has a lion carved on each side, and on the back.
            The area is bounded by a low rim, or seat, and about five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the mountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of the most remote antiquity.”
        </p>

        <p>
            So successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable fortune. He married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single, the other married a Chian.
        </p>

        <p>
            The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages of the poems with the history of the poet, which has already been mentioned:—
        </p>

        <p>
            “In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards Mentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his poem as the companion of Ulysses,<a href="#fn13" name="fnref13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> in return for the
            care taken of him when afflicted with blindness. He also testifies his gratitude to Phemius, who had given him both sustenance and instruction.”
        </p>

        <p>
            His celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to visit Greece, whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is said, made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity of the Athenians, of whose city he had hitherto
            made no mention,<a href="#fn14" name="fnref14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> he sent out for Samos. Here being recognized by a Samian, who had met with him in Chios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in celebrating the Apaturian
            festival. He recited some verses, which gave great satisfaction, and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon festivals, he earned a subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich, with whose children he was very popular.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios, now Ino, where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his death arose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed by some fishermen’s children.
            <a href="#fn15" name="fnref15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Such is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we possess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in detail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a persevering,
            patient, and learned—but by no means consistent—series of investigations has led. In doing so, I profess to bring forward statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability.
        </p>

        <p>
            “Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who have done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The majestic stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing,
            flows like the Nile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the Nile, its fountains will ever remain concealed.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the Homeric question is involved. With no less truth and feeling he proceeds:—
        </p>

        <p>
            “It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of things makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the region of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The creations of genius always seem like miracles,
            because they are, for the most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in all essential
            points, must have remained the secret of the poet.”<a href="#fn16" name="fnref16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer an individual?<a href="#fn17" name="fnref17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>            or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?
        </p>

        <p>
            Well has Landor remarked: “Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some deny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our
            composure, our devotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know what is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do.”<a href="#fn18"
                name="fnref18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute analysis—our editorial office compels
            us to give some attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric question is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to prefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend to dry details.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before, however, entering into particulars respecting the question of this unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks:—
        </p>

        <p>
            “We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its original composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive integrity was called in question;
            nor is it injustice to assert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite anatomist may be no judge
            of the symmetry of the human frame: and we would take the opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.
        </p>

        <p>
            “There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines of Pope.—
        </p>

        <p class="poem">
            “‘The critic eye—that microscope of wit<br> Sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit,<br> How parts relate to parts, or they to whole,<br> The body’s harmony, the beaming soul,<br> Are things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see,<br> When
            man’s whole frame is obvious to a flea.’”<a href="#fn19" name="fnref19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo,<a href="#fn20" name="fnref20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>            the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics. Longinus, in an oft quoted passage, merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad,
            <a href="#fn21" name="fnref21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> and, among a mass of ancient authors, whose very names<a href="#fn22" name="fnref22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> it would be tedious to detail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of Homer
            ever arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject; let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on the subject, and we find Bentley remarking that “Homer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and good cheer, at festivals and other days of
            merriment. These loose songs were not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about Peisistratus’ time, about five hundred years after.”<a href="#fn23" name="fnref23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
        </p>

            Two French writers—Hedelin and Perrault—avowed a similar scepticism on the subject; but it is in the “Scienza Nuova” of Battista Vico, that we first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf with so much learning and acuteness. Indeed,
            it is with the Wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following bold hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote:—<a href="#fn24" name="fnref24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            “Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf, turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the Homeric text. A considerable part of
            that dissertation (though by no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into
            any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the
            earlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to
            posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf’s case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey.
            By Nitzsch, and other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the
            Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning.
        </p>

        <p>
            “To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are nowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view of the question, if it could be shown,
            that, in order to controvert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems, in the ninth century before the Christian æra. Few things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight, opposed as he is to the
            Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than Wolf himself. The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh century before the Christian æra, are exceedingly trifling. We have no remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad,
            and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonidês of Amorgus, Kallinus, Tyrtæus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets, committed their compositions
            to writing, or at what time the practice of doing so became familiar. The first positive ground which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the famous ordinance of Solôn, with regard to the rhapsodies at the
            Panathenæa: but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed, we are unable to say.
        </p>

        <p>
            “Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the beginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the existing habits of society with regard to poetry—for they admit generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read,
            but recited and heard,—but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems—the unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy. But here we only escape a smaller
            difficulty by running into a greater; for the existence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory,<a href="#fn25" name="fnref25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> is far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts, in an age essentially
            non-reading and non-writing, and when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious. Moreover, there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting
            a manuscript; for if such had been the fact, blindness would have been a disqualification for the profession, which we know that it was not, as well from the example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of Chios, in
            the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as well as the general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself. The author of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection
            in his art, if he had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his chest.”
        </p>

        <p>
            The loss of the digamma, that <i>crux</i> of critics, that quicksand upon which even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond a doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a considerable change. Now
            it is certainly difficult to suppose that the Homeric poems could have suffered by this change, had written copies been preserved. If Chaucer’s poetry, for instance, had not been written, it could only have come down to us in a softened form,
            more like the effeminate version of Dryden, than the rough, quaint, noble original.
        </p>

        <p>
            “At what period,” continues Grote, “these poems, or indeed any other Greek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture, though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of Solôn. If, in the absence of evidence, we may
            venture upon naming any more determinate period, the question at once suggests itself, What were the purposes which, in that state of society, a manuscript at its first commencement must have been intended to answer? For whom was a written
            Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was not only planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings, and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice, pauses, and other oral artifices
            which were required for emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce. Not for the general public—they were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded
            festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the crowd, and
            who would, on perusing the written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and
            there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed. If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing.
            Now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh century before the Christian æra (B.C. 660 to B.C. 630),
            the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonidês of Amorgus, &amp;c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music—the elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced
            as rivals to the primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication
            (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical effect; and the men who stood forward
            in it, may well be considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebaïs
            as the production of Homer. There seems, therefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this newly-formed and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old epics,—the Thebaïs and the Cypria, as
            well as the Iliad and the Odyssey,—began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century (B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish increased facilities for obtaining
            the requisite papyrus to write upon. A reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and the number of manuscripts along with it; so that before the time of Solôn, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though
            still comparatively few, might have attained a certain recognized authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodes.”

        <p>
            But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following observations—
        </p>

        <p>
            “There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion, throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid compilation, at least over the theory, that the Iliad was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions
            of the Athenian ruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of Grecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more than the fame, and the faint echo, if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonidês were employed in the noble
            task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much must have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is almost incredible, that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should not remain. Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected,
            anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the Homeric age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress
            as the fair one herself among the heroes of her age, however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing
            characteristics—still it is difficult to suppose that the language, particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts, should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression.
            It is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott has done in his continuation of Sir Tristram.
        </p>

        <p>
            “If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation. In later, and it may fairly be suspected
            in earlier times, the Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors. But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece embodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant part.
            Even the few passages which relate to their ancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible, indeed, that in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic fact, that in the great maritime expedition of western
            Greece against the rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadæ, the chieftain of Thessaly, from his valour and the number of his forces, may have been the most important ally of the Peloponnesian sovereign; the preeminent value of the
            ancient poetry on the Trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield to their taste. The songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no doubt, of far inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first sight,
            a Theseid would have been much more likely to have emanated from an Athenian synod of compilers of ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Olysseid. Could France have given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the hero of the Jerusalem.
            If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are sometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all its direful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the poetic cycle, as to admit no rivalry,—it is still surprising, that
            throughout the whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship of an Athenian hand, and that the national spirit of a race, who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring neighbours, the French,
            should submit with lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of their own ancestors—or, at least, to the questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military tactics of his age.”<a href="#fn27"

        </p>

        <p>
            To return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that Wolf’s objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey have never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial
            point, and that the difficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather augmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is Lachmann’s<a href="#fn28" name="fnref28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> modification of his theory
            any better. He divides the first twenty-two books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs, and treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of Peisistratus. This,
            as Grote observes, “explains the gaps and contradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else.” Moreover, we find no contradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading
            men in the first battle after the secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of the Eubœans; Tlepolemus, of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, of the Halizonians; Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes again make
            their appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure, that “it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel.” The discrepancy, by which Pylæmenes, who
            is represented as dead in the fifth book, weeps at his son’s funeral in the thirteenth, can only be regarded as the result of an interpolation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Grote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the subject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian theory, and of Lachmann’s modifications with the character of Peisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think
            with equal success, that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems, or, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by Peisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially distinct. In short, “a man may believe
            the Iliad to have been put together out of pre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the period of its first compilation.” The friends or literary
            <i>employês</i> of Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already ancient, and the silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic “recension,” goes far to prove, that, among the numerous manuscripts they examined, this
            was either wanting, or thought unworthy of attention.
        </p>

        <p>
            “Moreover,” he continues, “the whole tenor of the poems themselves confirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad or Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age of Peisistratus—nothing which brings to our
            view the alterations brought about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined money, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican governments, the close military array, the improved construction of ships, the Amphiktyonic
            convocations, the mutual frequentation of religious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &amp;c., familiar to the latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus, and the other literary friends of Peisistratus, could hardly
            have failed to notice, even without design, had they then, for the first time, undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into one large aggregate. Everything in the two great Homeric poems, both in substance and in language,
            belongs to an age two or three centuries earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the interpolations (or those passages which, on the best grounds, are pronounced to be such) betray no trace of the sixth century before Christ, and may well
            have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinus—in some cases even by Arktinus and Hesiod—as genuine Homeric matter.<a href="#fn29" name="fnref29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> As far as the evidences on the case, as well internal as external,
            enable us to judge, we seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand (always allowing for partial divergences of text and interpolations) in 776 B.C., our first trustworthy mark of Grecian
            time; and this ancient date, let it be added, as it is the best-authenticated fact, so it is also the most important attribute of the Homeric poems, considered in reference to Grecian history; for they thus afford us an insight into the anti-historical
            character of the Greeks, enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive contrasts between their former and their later condition.”<a href="#fn30" name="fnref30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of Peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although, I must confess, that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his labours. At the same time, so far from believing that the
            composition or primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the work of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that Athenian<a href="#fn31" name="fnref31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>            would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems, rather than to patch and re-construct them according to a fanciful hypothesis. I will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not,
            or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed author. Suffice it to say, that the more we read, the less satisfied we are upon either subject.
        </p>

        <p>
            I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version of the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical probability must be measured by that of many others
            relating to the Spartan Confucius.
        </p>

        <p>
            I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt, made by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like consistency. It is as follows:—
        </p>

        <p>
            “No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to ‘discourse in excellent music’ among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive
            to events passing around them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive
            memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first, and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of
            recitative, probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably.
        </p>

        <p>
            “It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Mœonides, but most probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on
            the social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays, connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the ‘Odyssea.’ The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem, which,
            in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent,
            than of his mere drudging arrangement of other people’s ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, ‘a great poet might have re-cast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere arrangers
            or compilers would be competent to do so.’
        </p>

        <p>
            “While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seized the hint that there presented itself, and the Achilleïs<a href="#fn32" name="fnref32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>            grew under his hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work: and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to the Cid, into a chronicle
            history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew that the poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but, first, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the
            streets, assemblies, and agoras. However, Solôn first, and then Peisistratus, and afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great measure.”<a href="#fn33"
                name="fnref33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions
            and interpolations disfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of the copyist, would be an absurd and captious assumption, but it is to a higher criticism
            that we must appeal, if we would either understand or enjoy these poems. In maintaining the authenticity and personality of their one author, be he Homer or Melesigenes, <i>quocunque
nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit</i>, I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful internal evidence, and that which springs
            from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary.
        </p>

        <p>
            The minutiæ of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise. Indeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an attempt would be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its importance in a philological view, I am inclined to
            set little store on its æsthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the emendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had they been suggested to the author by his Mæcenas or Africanus, he would probably have adopted.
            Moreover, those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often least competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not poets by profession, but may be so <i>per accidens</i>.
            I do not at this moment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage, although a mass of remarks, from Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a thousand minute points, without
            which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune.
        </p>

        <p>
            But it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously dissected his words and sentences, they proceed
            to use the axe and the pruning knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything but their wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book after book, passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a collection of
            fragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed the works of some great man, find that they have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories of Knight, Wolf, Lachmann, and others, we shall feel
            better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of Homer. One rejects what another considers the turning-point of his theory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting
            something else.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill, seems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies attributed to Seneca are by <i>four</i>            different authors.<a href="#fn34" name="fnref34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> Now, I will venture to assert, that these tragedies are so uniform, not only in their borrowed phraseology—a phraseology with which writers like Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus
            were more charmed than ourselves—in their freedom from real poetry, and last, but not least, in an ultra-refined and consistent abandonment of good taste, that few writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman,
            be he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great many more equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin astonished the world with the startling announcement that the Æneid of Virgil, and the satires of Horace, were literary
            deceptions. Now, without wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and learning—nay, the refined acuteness—which scholars, like Wolf, have bestowed upon this subject, I must express my fears, that many of our modern Homeric
            theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment, rather than the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I help thinking, that the literary history of more recent times will account for many points of difficulty in the transmission
            of the Iliad and Odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first creation.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus were of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason why corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in his day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus
            and Tibullus should have given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after all, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals,
            and which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does too much violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard
            of Chios. To believe the author of the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human invention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in the contemplation
            of a polypus. There is a catholicity, so to speak, in the very name of Homer. Our faith in the author of the Iliad may be a mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better.
        </p>

        <p>
            While, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature herself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in believing in Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers round the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare
            gifts from that wealth of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust,—still I am far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a rich fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whence he might
            derive both subject and embellishment. But it is one thing to <i>use</i> existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to patch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of style and execution can be
            hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?
        </p>

        <p>
            A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other bards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In fact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressions—nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of
            secondary agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be some grand pervading principle—some invisible, yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never come to the
            birth. Traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most pathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the poet;
            but, except the power to create a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their wild redundancy:
            we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will require little acuteness to detect.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware as I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief, it still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved for a higher criticism than it has often
            obtained. We are not by nature intended to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were faith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our ignorance
            on any matter. But we are too well taught the contrary lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity. And there is a kind
            of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter.
        </p>

        <p>
            Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts even to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and with a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply wrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell
            upon the minute spots which mere analysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem we must transform ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination must fight over the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the same sense of
            injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can but attain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for the reading of Homer), we shall feel that the poems of Homer are not only the work of one writer, but of
            the greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song.
        </p>

        <p>
            And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old. Heeren, who is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely observes:—
        </p>

        <p>
            “It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No poet has ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his countrymen. Prophets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the character of other nations; it was reserved to a poet to form that
            of the Greeks. This is a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy. When lawgivers and sages appeared in Greece, the work of the poet had already been accomplished; and they paid homage to
            his superior genius. He held up before his nation the mirror, in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no less than of feeble mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity and truth. His poems are founded on the first
            feeling of human nature; on the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which outweighs all others, the love of glory. His songs were poured forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man; and therefore they
            enter, and will continue to enter, every breast which cherishes the same sympathies. If it is granted to his immortal spirit, from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth, to look down on his race, to see the nations from the
            fields of Asia to the forests of Hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, which had been called
            into being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal spirit may reside, this alone would suffice to complete his happiness.”<a href="#fn35" name="fnref35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Can we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the “Apotheosis of Homer”
            <a href="#fn36" name="fnref36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> is depictured, and not feel how much of pleasing association, how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds, is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition?
            The more we read, and the more we think—think as becomes the readers of Homer,—the more rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of Poetry gave us this rich inheritance, whole and entire. Whatever were the means of its preservation, let
            us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use, than seek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories, whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other.

        <p>
            As the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not included in Pope’s translation, I will content myself with a brief account of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer who has done it full justice
            <a href="#fn37" name="fnref37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>:—
        </p>

        <p>
            “This poem,” says Coleridge, “is a short mock-heroic of ancient date. The text varies in different editions, and is obviously disturbed and corrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a juvenile essay of Homer’s genius; others have attributed
            it to the same Pigrees, mentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was uncertain; so little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies, know
            or care about that department of criticism employed in determining the genuineness of ancient writings. As to this little poem being a youthful profusion of Homer, it seems sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it is a plain
            and palpable parody, not only of the general spirit, but of the numerous passages of the Iliad itself; and even, if no such intention to parody were discernible in it, the objection would still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque
            to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse that order in the development of national taste, which the history of every other people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost ascertained to be a law of the human mind;
            it is in a state of society much more refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is contained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three other
            poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as much reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of them were of the Homeric age. Knight infers from the usage of the word deltos, “writing tablet,” instead
            of διφθέρα, “skin,” which, according to Herod. 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for that purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity; and generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is
            a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope’s design, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation, and on my own purpose in the present edition.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby. It is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general
            sense, rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes, which
            prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical attainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions already existing, than
            of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called literal translation was less cultivated than at present. If something like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised
            poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the poet’s meaning, his <i>words</i> were less jealously sought for, and those who could read so good a poem
            as Pope’s Iliad had fair reason to be satisfied.
        </p>

        <p>
            It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope’s translation by our own advancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look at it as a most delightful work in itself,—a work which is as much a part of English literature as Homer himself
            is of Greek. We must not be torn from our kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most cherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because Buttmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to
            ἀμφικύπελλον being an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from us to defend the faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman’s fine, bold, rough old English;—far be it from us to hold up his translation as what a translation
            of Homer <i>might</i> be. But we can still dismiss Pope’s Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books before they have read its fellow.
        </p>

        <p>
            As to the Notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up without pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general reader. Having some little time since translated all the works of Homer for another publisher, I might have brought
            a large amount of accumulated matter, sometimes of a critical character, to bear upon the text. But Pope’s version was no field for such a display; and my purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions, to notice occasionally
            <i>some</i> departures from the original, and to give a few parallel passages from our English Homer, Milton. In the latter task I cannot pretend to novelty, but I trust that my other annotations, while utterly disclaiming high scholastic
            views, will be found to convey as much as is wanted; at least, as far as the necessary limits of these volumes could be expected to admit. To write a commentary on Homer is not my present aim; but if I have made Pope’s translation a little
            more entertaining and instructive to a mass of miscellaneous readers, I shall consider my wishes satisfactorily accomplished.

        <h2>
            <a name="pref02"></a>POPE’S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER</h2>

        <p>
            Homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any writer whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested with him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellences; but his invention remains yet unrivalled.
            Nor is it a wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the invention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses: the utmost stretch
            of human study, learning, and industry, which masters everything besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes art with all her materials, and without it judgment itself can at best but “steal wisely:” for art is only like a prudent steward
            that lives on managing the riches of nature. Whatever praises may be given to works of judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them to which the invention must not contribute: as in the most regular gardens, art can only reduce beauties
            of nature to more regularity, and such a figure, which the common eye may better take in, and is, therefore, more entertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great
            and fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art, than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our author’s work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery, which contains the seeds and first productions
            of every kind, out of which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants, each according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if others are
            not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him. What he writes is of the most animated nature
            imaginable; every thing moves, every thing lives, and is put in action. If a council be called, or a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by the force
            of the poet’s imagination, and turns in one place to a hearer, in another to a spectator. The course of his verses resembles that of the army he describes,
        </p>

        <p class="poem">
            Οἵδ’ ἄῤ ἴσαν, ὡσεί τε πυρὶ χθὼν πἆσα νέμοιτο.
        </p>

        <p class="noindent">
            “They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it.” It is, however, remarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous, is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest splendour: it grows in the progress
            both upon himself and others, and becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity. Exact disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers, may have been found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this “vivida vis animi,”
            in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even while we disapprove. Nay, where this appears, though attended with absurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about
            it, till we see nothing but its own splendour. This fire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned as through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, but everywhere equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in sudden,
            short, and interrupted flashes: In Milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art: in Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from heaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns
            everywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly.
        </p>

        <p>
            I shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts of his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which distinguishes him from all other authors.
        </p>

        <p>
            This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the violence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole compass of nature, to supply his maxims and
            reflections; all the inward passions and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and boundless
            walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in the invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls “the soul of poetry,” was first breathed into it by Homer. I shall begin with considering him in his part, as it is naturally the
            first; and I speak of it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for fiction.
        </p>


        <p>
            Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the marvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as, though they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature; or of such as, though they did, became fables by
            the additional episodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of an epic poem, “The return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in Italy,” or the like. That of the Iliad is the “anger of Achilles,” the most short
            and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events, and crowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds, than are to be found
            even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a genius, aided himself
            by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer’s poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally
            carried it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his invention, but
            they have followed him in every episode and part of story. If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up their forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus, Virgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius
            (rather than omit them) destroys the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses visit the shades, the Æneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent after him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of Calypso, so
            is Æneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem, Rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account. If he gives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil
            and Tasso make the same present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed this close imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the way, supplied the want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon, and the taking of Troy, was copied
            (says Macrobius) almost word for word from Pisander, as the loves of Dido and Æneas are taken from those of Medea and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.
        </p>


        <p>
            To proceed to the allegorical fable—If we reflect upon those innumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories, what a new and ample scene of wonder may this
            consideration afford us! How fertile will that imagination appear, which was able to clothe all the properties of elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues and vices, in forms and persons, and to introduce them into actions agreeable
            to the nature of the things they shadowed! This is a field in which no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer, and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for their invention in having enlarged his circle,
            but for their judgment in having contracted it. For when the mode of learning changed in the following ages, and science was delivered in a plainer manner, it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside, as it was in
            Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was no unhappy circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem.
        </p>


        <p>
            The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially the machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the deities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of Greece, he seems the first who brought them into a system
            of machinery for poetry, and such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods, constantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support
            of it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic, that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have been able to enlarge the sphere of
            poetry beyond the limits he has set: every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the various changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day the gods of poetry.
        </p>


        <p>
            We come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a variety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them. Every one has something so singularly his own,
            that no painter could have distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by their manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single quality of
            courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters of the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and intractable; that of Diomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to command; that of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of
            Hector, active and vigilant: the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition; that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: we find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in Sarpedon a gallant and
            generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each character, but even in the under parts of it, to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal
            one. For example: the main characters of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this, that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural, open, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of
            courage; and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other upon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these kinds. The characters
            of Virgil are far from striking us in this open manner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and, where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike;
            even that of Turnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and we see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest. In like manner it may be remarked of Statius’s heroes,
            that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the same horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon, &amp;c. They have a parity of character, which makes them seem brothers of one family. I believe when the reader
            is led into this tract of reflection, if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic writers, he will be convinced how infinitely superior, in this point, the invention of Homer was to that of all others.
        </p>


        <p>
            The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters; being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners, of those who utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the Iliad, so there is of speeches, than in any
            other poem. “Everything in it has manner” (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is acted or spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how small a number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the dramatic part
            is less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches often consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be equally just in any person’s mouth upon the same occasion. As many of his persons have no apparent characters, so many
            of his speeches escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of the author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in Homer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that interests us less
            in the action described. Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil leaves us readers.
        </p>


        <p>
            If, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part Homer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient
            to prove the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they have so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture. Duport, in his Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort. And it is with
            justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if Virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so many that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is
            not fired by the Iliad.
        </p>

            If we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the invention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance of art, and individual of nature, summoned
            together by the extent and fecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various views presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions taken off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full prospects
            of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side views, unobserved by any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half the Iliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety
            of incidents, that no one bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and such a profusion of noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness, horror, and
            confusion. It is certain there is not near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him; and it is evident of Virgil especially, that he has scarce any comparisons
            which are not drawn from his master.
        </p>


        <p>
            If we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright imagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We acknowledge him the father of poetical diction; the first who taught that “language of the gods” to men. His expression
            is like the colouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on boldly, and executed with rapidity. It is, indeed, the strongest and most glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit. Aristotle had reason to say,
            he was the only poet who had found out “living words;” there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than in any good author whatever. An arrow is “impatient” to be on the wing, a weapon “thirsts” to drink the blood of an enemy, and the
            like, yet his expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in proportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the same degree that a thought
            is warmer, an expression will be brighter, as that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a greater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful,
            and the heat more intense.
        </p>


        <p>
            To throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected the compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted and filled the numbers with greater sound
            and pomp, and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the images. On this last consideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention, since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of supernumerary pictures
            of the persons or things to which they were joined. We see the motion of Hector’s plumes in the epithet Κορυθαίολος, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Εἰνοσίφυλλος, and so of others, which particular images could not have been insisted
            upon so long as to express them in a description (though but of a single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these epithets is a short description.
        </p>


        <p>
            Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of Greece, but searched through its different dialects
            with this particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or strength. What he
            most affected was the Ionic, which has a peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous
            fluency. With this he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the feebler Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its accent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the licence of poetry. Thus
            his measures, instead of being fetters to his sense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture, and even to give a further representation of his notions, in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified.
            Out of all these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not only the richest head, but the finest ear in the world. This is so great a truth, that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses, even without understanding
            them (with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will find more sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language of poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics
            to be copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some advantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and cadence of its verse, which
            agree with the genius of no other language. Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of, and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound
            of his line to a beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the only reason is, that fewer critics have understood one language than the other. Dionysius of Halicarnassus
            has pointed out many of our author’s beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the Composition of Words. It suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow with so much ease, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than
            to transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated, and, at the same time, with so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful river, always in motion, and always full;
            while we are borne away by a tide of verse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imaginable.
        </p>


        <p>
            Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us is his invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of his work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and copious than any other, his manners
            more lively and strongly marked, his speeches more affecting and transported, his sentiments more warm and sublime, his images and descriptions more full and animated, his expression more raised and daring, and his numbers more rapid and various.
            I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with regard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his character. Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages
            in them, and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: it is in that we are to consider him, and in proportion to his
            degree in that we are to admire him. No author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty; and as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in judgment. Not that we are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil
            had it in a more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in comparison with one
            another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work. Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil leads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters
            with a generous profusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the Nile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a river in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold their battles,
            methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate. Homer, boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all before him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil, calmly daring, like Æneas, appears undisturbed in the midst
            of the action; disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And when we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the heavens: Virgil, like
            the same power in his benevolence, counselling with the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his whole creation.
        </p>


        <p>
            But after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they naturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great
            judgment decline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If we look upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed
            from so noble a cause as the excess of this faculty.
        </p>


        <p>
            Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which so much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of probability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with
            unusual strength, exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become miracles in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit something near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances.
            Thus Homer has his “speaking horses;” and Virgil his “myrtles distilling blood;” where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability.
        </p>


        <p>
            It is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this faculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison
            is grounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, which, however, are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His similes are like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the
            original, but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent
            images. The reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of the same kind.
        </p>


        <p>
            If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he lived in. Such are his grosser representations
            of the gods; and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here speak a word of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into extremes, both by the censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a strange partiality to
            antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,
            <a href="#fn38" name="fnref38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> “that those times and manners are so much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours.” Who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those ages, when a
            spirit of revenge and cruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reigned through the world: when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre; when the greatest princes were put to the sword, and their wives and daughters made
            slaves and concubines? On the other side, I would not be so delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking
            a view of that simplicity, in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholding monarchs without their guards; princes tending their flocks, and princesses drawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to reflect that
            we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world; and those who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in the perusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more;
            that they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means
            alone their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates their dislike, will become a satisfaction.
        </p>

        <p>
            This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the same epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the “far-darting Phœbus,” the “blue-eyed Pallas,” the “swift-footed Achilles,” &amp;c., which some have censured as impertinent, and
            tediously repeated. Those of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them; and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of attributes
            with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the epithets of great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature of surnames, and repeated as such;
            for the Greeks having no names derived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction of each person; either naming his parents expressly, or his place of birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander the son of Philip, Herodotus
            of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &amp;c. Homer, therefore, complying with the custom of his country, used such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we have something parallel to these in modern times, such
            as the names of Harold Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince, &amp;c. If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the
            world into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the brazen and the iron one, of “heroes distinct from other men; a divine race who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by the care of Jupiter in the islands
            of the blessed.”<a href="#fn39" name="fnref39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> Now among the divine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in common with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet, and
            such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their families, actions or qualities.
        </p>

        <p>
            What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly deserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the same,
            as if one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one would imagine, by the whole course of their parallels, that these critics never so much as heard of Homer’s having written first; a consideration which whoever
            compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye. Some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and moral of the Æneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which
            might set the Odyssey above the Æneis; as that the hero is a wiser man, and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of the other; or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed; as because Achilles is not
            as good and perfect a prince as Æneas, when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character: it is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others select those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured
            as some that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of Scaliger in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement, oftener from an ignorance of
            the graces of the original, and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of Perrault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to a fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal
            merit of Homer, and that of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his times, and the prejudice of those that followed; and in pursuance of this principle,
            they make those accidents (such as the contention of the cities, &amp;c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality the consequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil, or any great author whose general character
            will infallibly raise many casual additions to their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de la Mott; who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had lived, he must have been the greatest poet of his nation, and that he
            may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him.
        </p>

        <p>
            In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his followers, he still continues superior to them.
            A cooler judgment may commit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment.
            Homer not only appears the inventor of poetry, but excels all the inventors of other arts, in this, that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him. What he has done admitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or
            regulation. He showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in some of his flights, it was but because he attempted everything. A work of this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from the most vigorous seed, is improved
            with industry, flourishes, and produces the finest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit join to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through
            a richness of nature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it remains to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief characteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem, such as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no
            translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in every particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too much softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the first
            grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and versification only are his proper province, since these must be his own, but the others he is to take as he finds them.
        </p>

        <p>
            It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language: but it is a great mistake to imagine
            (as many have done) that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the modern manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there is
            often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original, and supporting the poetical style of
            the translation: and I will venture to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by a servile, dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical, insolent hope of raising and improving their author.
            It is not to be doubted, that the fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his managing: however, it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole,
            without endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is, in any particular place. It is a great secret in writing, to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative; and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly
            in his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere English critic. Nothing
            that belongs to Homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion
            of simplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the certain signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in his train, while the poet himself
            is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be envied for such commendations, as he may gain by that character of
            style, which his friends must agree together to call simplicity, and the rest of the world will call dulness. There is a graceful and dignified simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; which differ as much from each other as the air of
            a plain man from that of a sloven: it is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all. Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.
        </p>

        <p>
            This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the Scripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the inspired writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words but what were intelligible and common to men
            at that time, and in that part of the world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any other writer. This consideration (together with what has been
            observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks, induce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several of those general phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a veneration even in our language from being
            used in the Old Testament; as, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the Divinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.
        </p>

        <p>
            For a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have something venerable, and as I may say, oracular,
            in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.
        </p>

        <p>
            Perhaps the mixture of some Græcisms and old words after the manner of Milton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other seems to require a venerable, antique cast.
            But certainly the use of modern terms of war and government, such as “platoon, campaign, junto,” or the like, (into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be allowable; those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat
            the subjects in any living language.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two peculiarities in Homer’s diction, which are a sort of marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight; those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects, and those who are, seemed pleased with them
            as beauties. I speak of his compound epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the former cannot be done literally into English without destroying the purity of our language. I believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves
            into an English compound, without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition, as well as those which have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets, and are become familiar through their use of them; such as
            “the cloud-compelling Jove,” &amp;c. As for the rest, whenever any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded one, the course to be taken is obvious.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one or two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the epithet εἰνοσίφυλλος to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous translated literally “leaf-shaking,” but affords
            a majestic idea in the periphrasis: “the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods.” Others that admit of different significations, may receive an advantage from a judicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are introduced.
            For example, the epithet of Apollo, ἑκηβόλος or “far-shooting,” is capable of two explications; one literal, in respect of the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other allegorical, with regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in
            such places where Apollo is represented as a god in person, I would use the former interpretation; and where the effects of the sun are described, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual
            repetition of the same epithets which we find in Homer, and which, though it might be accommodated (as has been already shown) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: but one may wait for opportunities of placing them, where
            they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed; and in doing this properly, a translator may at once show his fancy and his judgment.
        </p>

        <p>
            As for Homer’s repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of whole narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or hemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these, as neither to lose so known a mark of the
            author on the one hand, nor to offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods to
            men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn forms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the best rule is, to be guided by the nearness,
            or distance, at which the repetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one may vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious, the author is to
            answer for it.
        </p>

        <p>
            It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said) is perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every new subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry, and attainable by very few: I only
            know of Homer eminent for it in the Greek, and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed of his image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed this,
            in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those who have, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.
        </p>

            Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse has yet
            done. We have only those of Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent interpolations
            of four or six lines; and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty verses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other
            places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author; insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries he had revealed in Homer;
            and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in fustian; a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the tragedy of Bussy d’Amboise, &amp;c. In a word, the nature of
            the man may account for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface and remarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in poetry. His own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen weeks, shows
            with what negligence his version was performed. But that which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover his defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation, which is something like what one might imagine
            Homer himself would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but for particulars and circumstances he continually lops them, and often omits the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close translation, I doubt not many have been led into that
            error by the shortness of it, which proceeds not from his following the original line by line, but from the contractions above mentioned. He sometimes omits whole similes and sentences; and is now and then guilty of mistakes, into which no
            writer of his learning could have fallen, but through carelessness. His poetry, as well as Ogilby’s, is too mean for criticism.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live to translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small part of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities,
            it ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to have had too much regard to Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies, and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the original. However,
            had he translated the whole work, I would no more have attempted Homer after him than Virgil: his version of whom (notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited translation I know in any language. But the fate of great
            geniuses is like that of great ministers: though they are confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters, they must be envied and calumniated only for being at the head of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            That which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character: in particular places, where the sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest
            and most poetical, as most agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of his style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve, in the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more
            sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fulness and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the very cast of the periods;
            neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of antiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry. What I would
            further recommend to him is, to study his author rather from his own text, than from any commentaries, how learned soever, or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world; to consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil
            above all the ancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the Archbishop of Cambray’s Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author; and Bossu’s admirable Treatise of the Epic Poem the justest
            notion of his design and conduct. But after all, with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few; those only who have at once a taste of poetry, and
            competent learning. For to satisfy such a want either, is not in the nature of this undertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not modern, and a pedant nothing that is not Greek.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I have done is submitted to the public; from whose opinions I am prepared to learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets, who are most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst, whatever they shall please to say, they may
            give me some concern as they are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and by persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be true,
            that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit. Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task; who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as I cannot repeat without
            vanity. I was obliged to Sir Richard Steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the public. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his friend. The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel Garth
            are what I never knew wanting on any occasion. I must also acknowledge, with infinite pleasure, the many friendly offices, as well as sincere criticisms, of Mr. Congreve, who had led me the way in translating some parts of Homer. I must add
            the names of Mr. Rowe, and Dr. Parnell, though I shall take a further opportunity of doing justice to the last, whose good nature (to give it a great panegyric), is no less extensive than his learning. The favour of these gentlemen is not
            entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection. But what can I say of the honour so many of the great have done me; while the first names of the age appear as my subscribers, and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments
            of learning as my chief encouragers? Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find, that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to the name of poet: that his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not displeased I should
            undertake the author to whom he has given (in his excellent Essay), so complete a praise:
        </p>

        <p class="poem">
            “Read Homer once, and you can read no more;<br> For all books else appear so mean, so poor,<br> Verse will seem prose: but still persist to read,<br> And Homer will be all the books you need.”<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example: that such a genius as my Lord Bolingbroke, not more distinguished in the great
            scenes of business, than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not refused to be the critic of these sheets, and the patron of their writer: and that the noble author of the tragedy of “Heroic Love” has continued his partiality
            to me, from my writing pastorals to my attempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing, that I have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general, but their correction of several particulars of this
            translation.
        </p>

        <p>
            I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the Earl of Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of them. Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary
            of state, will pardon my desire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair. The particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late Lord Chancellor) gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his friendship. I
            must attribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends: to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can no way better oblige men of their turn than
            by my silence.
        </p>

        <p>
            In short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. He would have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens that has been shown me by its learned rival, the University of Oxford. And I can hardly envy him those pompous honours
            he received after death, when I reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy friendships, which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is the more to be acknowledged, as it is shown to one whose pen has never
            gratified the prejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of particular men. Whatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of an undertaking in which I have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of merit; and
            in which I hope to pass some of those years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies, after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others, nor disagreeable to myself.

            THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring towns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseïs and Briseïs, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles. Chryses, the father of Chryseïs, and priest of
            Apollo, comes to the Grecian camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in the tenth year of the siege. The priest being refused, and insolently dismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who inflicts a
            pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and encourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the refusal of Chryseïs. The king, being obliged to send back his captive, enters into a furious contest with Achilles,
            which Nestor pacifies; however, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on Briseïs in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his forces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she supplicates Jupiter
            to render them sensible of the wrong done to her son, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter, granting her suit, incenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are reconciled by the address of Vulcan.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
            time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine during the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes, and twelve for Jupiter’s stay with the Æthiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers her petition. The scene lies in
            the Grecian camp, then changes to Chrysa, and lastly to Olympus.

            Full on the sire the goddess of the skies<br> Roll’d the large orbs of her majestic eyes,<br> And thus return’d:—“Austere Saturnius, say,<br> From whence this wrath, or who controls thy sway?<br> Thy boundless will, for me, remains in force,<br>            And all thy counsels take the destined course.<br> But ’tis for Greece I fear: for late was seen,<br> In close consult, the silver-footed queen.<br> Jove to his Thetis nothing could deny,<br> Nor was the signal vain that shook the sky.<br>            What fatal favour has the goddess won,<br> To grace her fierce, inexorable son?<br> Perhaps in Grecian blood to drench the plain,<br> And glut his vengeance with my people slain.”

            THE TRIAL OF THE ARMY, AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            Jupiter, in pursuance of the request of Thetis, sends a deceitful vision to Agamemnon, persuading him to lead the army to battle, in order to make the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles. The general, who is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy
            without his assistance, but fears the army was discouraged by his absence, and the late plague, as well as by the length of time, contrives to make trial of their disposition by a stratagem. He first communicates his design to the princes
            in council, that he would propose a return to the soldiers, and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal was embraced. Then he assembles the whole host, and upon moving for a return to Greece, they unanimously agree to it, and run
            to prepare the ships. They are detained by the management of Ulysses, who chastises the insolence of Thersites. The assembly is recalled, several speeches made on the occasion, and at length the advice of Nestor followed, which was to make
            a general muster of the troops, and to divide them into their several nations, before they proceeded to battle. This gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the Greeks and Trojans, and in a large catalogue.<br>            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, and upon the sea-shore; towards the end it removes to Troy.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Now pleasing sleep had seal’d each mortal eye,<br> Stretch’d in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:<br> The immortals slumber’d on their thrones above;<br> All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.<a href="#fn76" name="fnref76"><sup>[76]</sup></a><br>            To honour Thetis’ son he bends his care,<br> And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:<br> Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,<br> And thus commands the vision of the night.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Fly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,<a href="#fn77" name="fnref77"><sup>[77]</sup></a><br> To Agamemnon’s ample tent repair.<br> Bid him in arms draw forth the embattled train,<br> Lead all his Grecians to the dusty plain.<br> Declare,
            e’en now ’tis given him to destroy<br> The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.<br> For now no more the gods with fate contend,<br> At Juno’s suit the heavenly factions end.<br> Destruction hangs o’er yon devoted wall,
            <br> And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.”

            Swift as the word the vain illusion fled,<br> Descends, and hovers o’er Atrides’ head;<br> Clothed in the figure of the Pylian sage,<br> Renown’d for wisdom, and revered for age:<br> Around his temples spreads his golden wing,<br> And thus

            ARGUMENT.
        </p>

        <p class="center">
            THE DUEL OF MENELAUS AND PARIS.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            The armies being ready to engage, a single combat is agreed upon between Menelaus and Paris (by the intervention of Hector) for the determination of the war. Iris is sent to call Helen to behold the fight. She leads her to the walls of Troy, where Priam
            sat with his counsellers observing the Grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom Helen gives an account of the chief of them. The kings on either part take the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat. The duel ensues; wherein Paris
            being overcome, he is snatched away in a cloud by Venus, and transported to his apartment. She then calls Helen from the walls, and brings the lovers together. Agamemnon, on the part of the Grecians, demands the restoration of Helen, and the
            performance of the articles.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. The scene is sometimes in the fields before Troy, and sometimes in Troy itself.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus by their leaders’ care each martial band<br> Moves into ranks, and stretches o’er the land.<br> With shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar,<br> Proclaim their motions, and provoke the war.<br> So when inclement winters vex the plain<br>            With piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,<br> To warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,<a href="#fn108" name="fnref108"><sup>[108]</sup></a><br> With noise, and order, through the midway sky;
            <br> To pigmy nations wounds and death they bring,<br> And all the war descends upon the wing,<br> But silent, breathing rage, resolved and skill’d<a href="#fn109" name="fnref109"><sup>[109]</sup></a><br> By mutual aids to fix a doubtful field,<br>            Swift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around<br> Darkening arises from the labour’d ground.<br> Thus from his flaggy wings when Notus sheds<br> A night of vapours round the mountain heads,<br> Swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,<br>            To thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;<br> While scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,<br> Lost and confused amidst the thicken’d day:<br> So wrapp’d in gathering dust, the Grecian train,<br> A moving cloud, swept on, and
            hid the plain.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Now front to front the hostile armies stand,<br> Eager of fight, and only wait command;<br> When, to the van, before the sons of fame<br> Whom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came:<br> In form a god! the panther’s speckled hide<br> Flow’d
            o’er his armour with an easy pride:<br> His bended bow across his shoulders flung,<br> His sword beside him negligently hung;<br> Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,<br> And dared the bravest of the Grecian race.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            As thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,<br> He boldly stalk’d, the foremost on the plain,<br> Him Menelaus, loved of Mars, espies,<br> With heart elated, and with joyful eyes:<br> So joys a lion, if the branching deer,<br> Or mountain
            goat, his bulky prize, appear;<br> Eager he seizes and devours the slain,<br> Press’d by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.<br> Thus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,<br> In clanging arms he leaps upon the ground<br> From his high
            chariot: him, approaching near,<br> The beauteous champion views with marks of fear,<br> Smit with a conscious sense, retires behind,<br> And shuns the fate he well deserved to find.<br> As when some shepherd, from the rustling trees<a href="#fn110"
                name="fnref110"><sup>[110]</sup></a><br> Shot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees,<br> Trembling and pale, he starts with wild affright<br> And all confused precipitates his flight:<br> So from the king the shining warrior flies,<br> And plunged
            amid the thickest Trojans lies.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            As godlike Hector sees the prince retreat,<br> He thus upbraids him with a generous heat:<br> “Unhappy Paris!<a href="#fn111" name="fnref111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> but to women brave!<br> So fairly form’d, and only to deceive!<br> Oh, hadst
            thou died when first thou saw’st the light,<br> Or died at least before thy nuptial rite!<br> A better fate than vainly thus to boast,<br> And fly, the scandal of thy Trojan host.<br> Gods! how the scornful Greeks exult to see<br> Their fears
            of danger undeceived in thee!<br> Thy figure promised with a martial air,<br> But ill thy soul supplies a form so fair.<br> In former days, in all thy gallant pride,<br> When thy tall ships triumphant stemm’d the tide,
            <br> When Greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,<br> And crowds stood wondering at the passing show,<br> Say, was it thus, with such a baffled mien,<br> You met the approaches of the Spartan queen,<br> Thus from her realm convey’d the beauteous
            prize,
            <br> And both her warlike lords outshined in Helen’s eyes?<br> This deed, thy foes’ delight, thy own disgrace,<br> Thy father’s grief, and ruin of thy race;<br> This deed recalls thee to the proffer’d fight;
            <br> Or hast thou injured whom thou dar’st not right?<br> Soon to thy cost the field would make thee know<br> Thou keep’st the consort of a braver foe.<br> Thy graceful form instilling soft desire,<br> Thy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre,
            <br> Beauty and youth; in vain to these you trust,<br> When youth and beauty shall be laid in dust:<br> Troy yet may wake, and one avenging blow<br> Crush the dire author of his country’s woe.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            His silence here, with blushes, Paris breaks:<br> “’Tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks:<br> But who like thee can boast a soul sedate,<br> So firmly proof to all the shocks of fate?<br> Thy force, like steel, a temper’d hardness
            shows,
            <br> Still edged to wound, and still untired with blows,<br> Like steel, uplifted by some strenuous swain,<br> With falling woods to strew the wasted plain.<br> Thy gifts I praise; nor thou despise the charms<br> With which a lover golden
            Venus arms;<br> Soft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,<br> No wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.<br> Yet, would’st thou have the proffer’d combat stand,<br> The Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand;<br> Then let a midway space
            our hosts divide,<br> And, on that stage of war, the cause be tried:<br> By Paris there the Spartan king be fought,<br> For beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought;<br> And who his rival can in arms subdue,<br> His be the fair, and his
            the treasure too.<br> Thus with a lasting league your toils may cease,<br> And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace;<br> Thus may the Greeks review their native shore,<br> Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He said. The challenge Hector heard with joy,<br> Then with his spear restrain’d the youth of Troy,<br> Held by the midst, athwart; and near the foe<br> Advanced with steps majestically slow:<br> While round his dauntless head the Grecians
            pour
            <br> Their stones and arrows in a mingled shower.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then thus the monarch, great Atrides, cried:<br> “Forbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside:<br> A parley Hector asks, a message bears;<br> We know him by the various plume he wears.”<br> Awed by his high command the Greeks attend,<br> The
            tumult silence, and the fight suspend.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            While from the centre Hector rolls his eyes<br> On either host, and thus to both applies:<br> “Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,<br> What Paris, author of the war, demands.<br> Your shining swords within the sheath restrain,<br> And
            pitch your lances in the yielding plain.<br> Here in the midst, in either army’s sight,<br> He dares the Spartan king to single fight;<br> And wills that Helen and the ravish’d spoil,<br> That caused the contest, shall reward the toil.<br>            Let these the brave triumphant victor grace,<br> And different nations part in leagues of peace.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He spoke: in still suspense on either side<br> Each army stood: the Spartan chief replied:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right<br> A world engages in the toils of fight.<br> To me the labour of the field resign;<br> Me Paris injured; all the war be mine.<br> Fall he that must, beneath his rival’s arms;<br> And live the
            rest, secure of future harms.<br> Two lambs, devoted by your country’s rite,<br> To earth a sable, to the sun a white,<br> Prepare, ye Trojans! while a third we bring<br> Select to Jove, the inviolable king.<br> Let reverend Priam in the truce
            engage,
            <br> And add the sanction of considerate age;<br> His sons are faithless, headlong in debate,<br> And youth itself an empty wavering state;<br> Cool age advances, venerably wise,<br> Turns on all hands its deep-discerning eyes;<br> Sees what
            befell, and what may yet befall,<br> Concludes from both, and best provides for all.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The nations hear with rising hopes possess’d,<br> And peaceful prospects dawn in every breast.<br> Within the lines they drew their steeds around,<br> And from their chariots issued on the ground;<br> Next, all unbuckling the rich mail they
            wore,
            <br> Laid their bright arms along the sable shore.<br> On either side the meeting hosts are seen<br> With lances fix’d, and close the space between.<br> Two heralds now, despatch’d to Troy, invite<br> The Phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Talthybius hastens to the fleet, to bring<br> The lamb for Jove, the inviolable king.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Meantime to beauteous Helen, from the skies<br> The various goddess of the rainbow flies:<br> (Like fair Laodice in form and face,<br> The loveliest nymph of Priam’s royal race:)<br> Her in the palace, at her loom she found;<br> The golden
            web her own sad story crown’d,<br> The Trojan wars she weaved (herself the prize)<br> And the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes.<br> To whom the goddess of the painted bow:<br> “Approach, and view the wondrous scene below!<a href="#fn112" name="fnref112"><sup>[112]</sup></a><br>            Each hardy Greek, and valiant Trojan knight,<br> So dreadful late, and furious for the fight,<br> Now rest their spears, or lean upon their shields;<br> Ceased is the war, and silent all the fields.<br> Paris alone and Sparta’s king advance,<br>            In single fight to toss the beamy lance;<br> Each met in arms, the fate of combat tries,<br> Thy love the motive, and thy charms the prize.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            This said, the many-coloured maid inspires<br> Her husband’s love, and wakes her former fires;<br> Her country, parents, all that once were dear,<br> Rush to her thought, and force a tender tear,<br> O’er her fair face a snowy veil she threw,<br>            And, softly sighing, from the loom withdrew.<br> Her handmaids, Clymene and Æthra, wait<br> Her silent footsteps to the Scaean gate.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            There sat the seniors of the Trojan race:<br> (Old Priam’s chiefs, and most in Priam’s grace,)<br> The king the first; Thymoetes at his side;<br> Lampus and Clytius, long in council tried;<br> Panthus, and Hicetaon, once the strong;<br> And
            next, the wisest of the reverend throng,<br> Antenor grave, and sage Ucalegon,<br> Lean’d on the walls and bask’d before the sun:<br> Chiefs, who no more in bloody fights engage,<br> But wise through time, and narrative with age,<br> In summer
            days, like grasshoppers rejoice,<br> A bloodless race, that send a feeble voice.<br> These, when the Spartan queen approach’d the tower,<br> In secret own’d resistless beauty’s power:<br> They cried, “No wonder<a href="#fn113" name="fnref113"><sup>[113]</sup></a>            such celestial charms<br> For nine long years have set the world in arms;<br> What winning graces! what majestic mien!<br> She moves a goddess, and she looks a queen!<br> Yet hence, O Heaven, convey that fatal face,<br> And from destruction
            save the Trojan race.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The good old Priam welcomed her, and cried,<br> “Approach, my child, and grace thy father’s side.<br> See on the plain thy Grecian spouse appears,<br> The friends and kindred of thy former years.<br> No crime of thine our present sufferings
            draws,
            <br> Not thou, but Heaven’s disposing will, the cause<br> The gods these armies and this force employ,<br> The hostile gods conspire the fate of Troy.<br> But lift thy eyes, and say, what Greek is he<br> (Far as from hence these aged orbs
            can see)<br> Around whose brow such martial graces shine,<br> So tall, so awful, and almost divine!<br> Though some of larger stature tread the green,<br> None match his grandeur and exalted mien:<br> He seems a monarch, and his country’s
            pride.”
            <br> Thus ceased the king, and thus the fair replied:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Before thy presence, father, I appear,<br> With conscious shame and reverential fear.<br> Ah! had I died, ere to these walls I fled,<br> False to my country, and my nuptial bed;<br> My brothers, friends, and daughter left behind,<br> False
            to them all, to Paris only kind!<br> For this I mourn, till grief or dire disease<br> Shall waste the form whose fault it was to please!<br> The king of kings, Atrides, you survey,<br> Great in the war, and great in arts of sway:<br> My brother
            once, before my days of shame!<br> And oh! that still he bore a brother’s name!”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            With wonder Priam view’d the godlike man,<br> Extoll’d the happy prince, and thus began:<br> “O bless’d Atrides! born to prosperous fate,<br> Successful monarch of a mighty state!<br> How vast thy empire! Of your matchless train<br> What numbers
            lost, what numbers yet remain!<br> In Phrygia once were gallant armies known,<br> In ancient time, when Otreus fill’d the throne,<br> When godlike Mygdon led their troops of horse,<br> And I, to join them, raised the Trojan force:<br> Against
            the manlike Amazons we stood,<a href="#fn114" name="fnref114"><sup>[114]</sup></a><br> And Sangar’s stream ran purple with their blood.<br> But far inferior those, in martial grace,<br> And strength of numbers, to this Grecian race.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            This said, once more he view’d the warrior train;<br> “What’s he, whose arms lie scatter’d on the plain?<br> Broad is his breast, his shoulders larger spread,<br> Though great Atrides overtops his head.<br> Nor yet appear his care and conduct
            small;
            <br> From rank to rank he moves, and orders all.<br> The stately ram thus measures o’er the ground,<br> And, master of the flock, surveys them round.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then Helen thus: “Whom your discerning eyes<br> Have singled out, is Ithacus the wise;<br> A barren island boasts his glorious birth;<br> His fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Antenor took the word, and thus began:<a href="#fn115" name="fnref115"><sup>[115]</sup></a><br> “Myself, O king! have seen that wondrous man<br> When, trusting Jove and hospitable laws,<br> To Troy he came, to plead the Grecian cause;<br>            (Great Menelaus urged the same request;)<br> My house was honour’d with each royal guest:<br> I knew their persons, and admired their parts,<br> Both brave in arms, and both approved in arts.<br> Erect, the Spartan most engaged our view;<br>            Ulysses seated, greater reverence drew.<br> When Atreus’ son harangued the listening train,<br> Just was his sense, and his expression plain,<br> His words succinct, yet full, without a fault;<br> He spoke no more than just the thing he ought.<br>            But when Ulysses rose, in thought profound,<a href="#fn116" name="fnref116"><sup>[116]</sup></a><br> His modest eyes he fix’d upon the ground;
            <br> As one unskill’d or dumb, he seem’d to stand,<br> Nor raised his head, nor stretch’d his sceptred hand;<br> But, when he speaks, what elocution flows!<br> Soft as the fleeces of descending snows,<a href="#fn117" name="fnref117"><sup>[117]</sup></a><br>            The copious accents fall, with easy art;<br> Melting they fall, and sink into the heart!<br> Wondering we hear, and fix’d in deep surprise,<br> Our ears refute the censure of our eyes.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The king then ask’d (as yet the camp he view’d)<br> “What chief is that, with giant strength endued,<br> Whose brawny shoulders, and whose swelling chest,<br> And lofty stature, far exceed the rest?<br> “Ajax the great, (the beauteous queen
            replied,)
            <br> Himself a host: the Grecian strength and pride.<br> See! bold Idomeneus superior towers<br> Amid yon circle of his Cretan powers,<br> Great as a god! I saw him once before,<br> With Menelaus on the Spartan shore.<br> The rest I know,
            and could in order name;<br> All valiant chiefs, and men of mighty fame.<br> Yet two are wanting of the numerous train,<br> Whom long my eyes have sought, but sought in vain:<br> Castor and Pollux, first in martial force,<br> One bold on foot,
            and one renown’d for horse.<br> My brothers these; the same our native shore,<br> One house contain’d us, as one mother bore.<br> Perhaps the chiefs, from warlike toils at ease,<br> For distant Troy refused to sail the seas;<br> Perhaps their
            swords some nobler quarrel draws,<br> Ashamed to combat in their sister’s cause.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            So spoke the fair, nor knew her brothers’ doom;<a href="#fn118" name="fnref118"><sup>[118]</sup></a><br> Wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb;<br> Adorn’d with honours in their native shore,
            <br> Silent they slept, and heard of wars no more.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Meantime the heralds, through the crowded town,<br> Bring the rich wine and destined victims down.<br> Idaeus’ arms the golden goblets press’d,<a href="#fn119" name="fnref119"><sup>[119]</sup></a><br> Who thus the venerable king address’d:<br>            “Arise, O father of the Trojan state!<br> The nations call, thy joyful people wait<br> To seal the truce, and end the dire debate.<br> Paris, thy son, and Sparta’s king advance,<br> In measured lists to toss the weighty lance;<br> And who
            his rival shall in arms subdue,<br> His be the dame, and his the treasure too.<br> Thus with a lasting league our toils may cease,<br> And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace:<br> So shall the Greeks review their native shore,<br> Much
            famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            With grief he heard, and bade the chiefs prepare<br> To join his milk-white coursers to the car;<br> He mounts the seat, Antenor at his side;<br> The gentle steeds through Scaea’s gates they guide:<a href="#fn120" name="fnref120"><sup>[120]</sup></a><br>            Next from the car descending on the plain,<br> Amid the Grecian host and Trojan train,<br> Slow they proceed: the sage Ulysses then<br> Arose, and with him rose the king of men.<br> On either side a sacred herald stands,<br> The wine they
            mix, and on each monarch’s hands<br> Pour the full urn; then draws the Grecian lord<br> His cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword;<br> From the sign’d victims crops the curling hair;<a href="#fn121" name="fnref121"><sup>[121]</sup></a><br>            The heralds part it, and the princes share;<br> Then loudly thus before the attentive bands<br> He calls the gods, and spreads his lifted hands:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O first and greatest power! whom all obey,<br> Who high on Ida’s holy mountain sway,<br> Eternal Jove! and you bright orb that roll<br> From east to west, and view from pole to pole!<br> Thou mother Earth! and all ye living floods!<br> Infernal
            furies, and Tartarean gods,<br> Who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare<br> For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!<br> Hear, and be witness. If, by Paris slain,<br> Great Menelaus press the fatal plain;<br> The dame and treasures
            let the Trojan keep,<br> And Greece returning plough the watery deep.<br> If by my brother’s lance the Trojan bleed,<br> Be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed:<br> The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay,<br> And every age record the
            signal day.<br> This if the Phrygians shall refuse to yield,<br> Arms must revenge, and Mars decide the field.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            With that the chief the tender victims slew,<br> And in the dust their bleeding bodies threw;<br> The vital spirit issued at the wound,<br> And left the members quivering on the ground.<br> From the same urn they drink the mingled wine,<br>            And add libations to the powers divine.<br> While thus their prayers united mount the sky,<br> “Hear, mighty Jove! and hear, ye gods on high!<br> And may their blood, who first the league confound,<br> Shed like this wine, disdain the thirsty
            ground;
            <br> May all their consorts serve promiscuous lust,<br> And all their lust be scatter’d as the dust!”<br> Thus either host their imprecations join’d,<br> Which Jove refused, and mingled with the wind.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The rites now finish’d, reverend Priam rose,<br> And thus express’d a heart o’ercharged with woes:<br> “Ye Greeks and Trojans, let the chiefs engage,<br> But spare the weakness of my feeble age:<br> In yonder walls that object let me shun,<br>            Nor view the danger of so dear a son.<br> Whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall,<br> Heaven only knows; for heaven disposes all.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            This said, the hoary king no longer stay’d,<br> But on his car the slaughter’d victims laid:<br> Then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide,<br> And drove to Troy, Antenor at his side.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Bold Hector and Ulysses now dispose<br> The lists of combat, and the ground inclose:<br> Next to decide, by sacred lots prepare,<br> Who first shall launch his pointed spear in air.<br> The people pray with elevated hands,<br> And words like
            these are heard through all the bands:<br> “Immortal Jove, high Heaven’s superior lord,<br> On lofty Ida’s holy mount adored!<br> Whoe’er involved us in this dire debate,<br> O give that author of the war to fate<br> And shades eternal! let
            division cease,<br> And joyful nations join in leagues of peace.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">

            ARGUMENT.
        </p>

        <p class="center">
            THE BREACH OF THE TRUCE, AND THE FIRST BATTLE.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            The gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war: they agree upon the continuation of it, and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break the truce. She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who is wounded, but cured by Machaon. In the meantime
            some of the Trojan troops attack the Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts of a good general; he reviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders, some by praises and others by reproof. Nestor is particularly celebrated for his military
            discipline. The battle joins, and great numbers are slain on both sides.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same day continues through this as through the last book (as it does also through the two following, and almost to the end
            of the seventh book). The scene is wholly in the field before Troy.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            And now Olympus’ shining gates unfold;<br> The gods, with Jove, assume their thrones of gold:<br> Immortal Hebe, fresh with bloom divine,<br> The golden goblet crowns with purple wine:<br> While the full bowls flow round, the powers employ<br>            Their careful eyes on long-contended Troy.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            When Jove, disposed to tempt Saturnia’s spleen,<br> Thus waked the fury of his partial queen,<br> “Two powers divine the son of Atreus aid,<br> Imperial Juno, and the martial maid;<a href="#fn125" name="fnref125"><sup>[125]</sup></a><br> But
            high in heaven they sit, and gaze from far,<br> The tame spectators of his deeds of war.<br> Not thus fair Venus helps her favour’d knight,<br> The queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight,<br> Each danger wards, and constant in her care,
            <br> Saves in the moment of the last despair.<br> Her act has rescued Paris’ forfeit life,<br> Though great Atrides gain’d the glorious strife.<br> Then say, ye powers! what signal issue waits<br> To crown this deed, and finish all the fates!
            <br> Shall Heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare,<br> Or rouse the furies, and awake the war?<br> Yet, would the gods for human good provide,<br> Atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride,<br> Still Priam’s walls in peaceful honours
            grow,
            <br> And through his gates the crowding nations flow.”

        <p class="verse">
            Thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged,<br> And queen of war, in close consult engaged:<br> Apart they sit, their deep designs employ,<br> And meditate the future woes of Troy.<br> Though secret anger swell’d Minerva’s breast,<br>            The prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress’d;<br> But Juno, impotent of passion, broke<br> Her sullen silence, and with fury spoke:

        <p class="verse">

            ARGUMENT.
        </p>

        <p class="center">
            THE ACTS OF DIOMED.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            Diomed, assisted by Pallas, performs wonders in this day’s battle. Pandarus wounds him with an arrow, but the goddess cures him, enables him to discern gods from mortals, and prohibits him from contending with any of the former, excepting Venus. Æneas
            joins Pandarus to oppose him; Pandarus is killed, and Æneas in great danger but for the assistance of Venus; who, as she is removing her son from the fight, is wounded on the hand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his rescue, and at length
            carries off Æneas to Troy, where he is healed in the temple of Pergamus. Mars rallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to make a stand. In the meantime Æneas is restored to the field, and they overthrow several of the Greeks; among the rest
            Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon. Juno and Minerva descend to resist Mars; the latter incites Diomed to go against that god; he wounds him, and sends him groaning to heaven.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first battle continues
            through this book. The scene is the same as in the former.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            But Pallas now Tydides’ soul inspires,<a href="#fn143" name="fnref143"><sup>[143]</sup></a><br> Fills with her force, and warms with all her fires,<br> Above the Greeks his deathless fame to raise,<br> And crown her hero with distinguish’d
            praise.
            <br> High on his helm celestial lightnings play,<br> His beamy shield emits a living ray;<br> The unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,<br> Like the red star that fires the autumnal skies,
            <br> When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,<br> And, bathed in ocean, shoots a keener light.<br> Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow’d,<br> Such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow’d:<br> Onward she drives him, furious to
            engage,
            <br> Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The sons of Dares first the combat sought,<br> A wealthy priest, but rich without a fault;<br> In Vulcan’s fane the father’s days were led,<br> The sons to toils of glorious battle bred;<br> These singled from their troops the fight maintain,<br>            These, from their steeds, Tydides on the plain.<br> Fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,<br> And first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spear,<br> Which o’er the warrior’s shoulder took its course,<br> And spent in empty air its erring
            force.
            <br> Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,<br> But pierced his breast, and stretch’d him on the plain.<br> Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,<br> Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.<br> And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid,
            <br> He too had sunk to death’s eternal shade;<br> But in a smoky cloud the god of fire<br> Preserved the son, in pity to the sire.<br> The steeds and chariot, to the navy led,<br> Increased the spoils of gallant Diomed.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Struck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew,<br> Or slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view;<br> When by the blood-stain’d hand Minerva press’d<br> The god of battles, and this speech address’d:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Stern power of war! by whom the mighty fall,<br> Who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!<br> Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;<br> And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide:<br> While we from interdicted fields retire,<br>            Nor tempt the wrath of heaven’s avenging sire.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Her words allay the impetuous warrior’s heat,<br> The god of arms and martial maid retreat;<br> Removed from fight, on Xanthus’ flowery bounds<br> They sat, and listen’d to the dying sounds.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Meantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue,<br> And some bold chieftain every leader slew:<br> First Odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,<br> His death ennobled by Atrides’ hand:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            As he to flight his wheeling car address’d,<br> The speedy javelin drove from back to breast.<br> In dust the mighty Halizonian lay,<br> His arms resound, the spirit wings its way.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thy fate was next, O Phaestus! doom’d to feel<br> The great Idomeneus’ protended steel;<br> Whom Borus sent (his son and only joy)<br> From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy.<br> The Cretan javelin reach’d him from afar,<br> And pierced
            his shoulder as he mounts his car;<br> Back from the car he tumbles to the ground,<br> And everlasting shades his eyes surround.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then died Scamandrius, expert in the chase,<br> In woods and wilds to wound the savage race;<br> Diana taught him all her sylvan arts,<br> To bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:<br> But vainly here Diana’s arts he tries,<br> The fatal lance
            arrests him as he flies;<br> From Menelaus’ arm the weapon sent,<br> Through his broad back and heaving bosom went:<br> Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,<br> His brazen armour rings against the ground.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Next artful Phereclus untimely fell;<br> Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.<br> Thy father’s skill, O Phereclus! was thine,<br> The graceful fabric and the fair design;<br> For loved by Pallas, Pallas did impart<br> To him the shipwright’s
            and the builder’s art.<br> Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose,<br> The fatal cause of all his country’s woes;<br> But he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,<br> Nor saw his country’s peril, nor his own.<br> The hapless artist, while
            confused he fled,<br> The spear of Merion mingled with the dead.<br> Through his right hip, with forceful fury cast,<br> Between the bladder and the bone it pass’d;<br> Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,<br> And death in lasting
            slumber seals his eyes.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            From Meges’ force the swift Pedaeus fled,<br> Antenor’s offspring from a foreign bed,<br> Whose generous spouse, Theanor, heavenly fair,<br> Nursed the young stranger with a mother’s care.<br> How vain those cares! when Meges in the rear<br>            Full in his nape infix’d the fatal spear;<br> Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,<br> And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then died Hypsenor, generous and divine,<br> Sprung from the brave Dolopion’s mighty line,<br> Who near adored Scamander made abode,<br> Priest of the stream, and honoured as a god.<br> On him, amidst the flying numbers found,<br> Eurypylus
            inflicts a deadly wound;<br> On his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,<br> Thence glancing downwards, lopp’d his holy hand,<br> Which stain’d with sacred blood the blushing sand.<br> Down sunk the priest: the purple hand of death<br>            Closed his dim eye, and fate suppress’d his breath.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus toil’d the chiefs, in different parts engaged.<br> In every quarter fierce Tydides raged;<br> Amid the Greek, amid the Trojan train,<br> Rapt through the ranks he thunders o’er the plain;<br> Now here, now there, he darts from place to
            place,
            <br> Pours on the rear, or lightens in their face.<br> Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong<br> Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,<br> Through ruin’d moles the rushing wave resounds,<br> O’erwhelm’s the bridge, and
            bursts the lofty bounds;<br> The yellow harvests of the ripen’d year,<br> And flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!<a href="#fn144" name="fnref144"><sup>[144]</sup></a><br> While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,<br> And all the labours
            of mankind are vain.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            So raged Tydides, boundless in his ire,<br> Drove armies back, and made all Troy retire.<br> With grief the leader of the Lycian band<br> Saw the wide waste of his destructive hand:<br> His bended bow against the chief he drew;<br> Swift to
            the mark the thirsty arrow flew,<br> Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,<br> Deep in his shoulder pierced, and drank the gore:<br> The rushing stream his brazen armour dyed,<br> While the proud archer thus exulting cried:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Hither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds!<br> Lo! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds,<br> Not long the deathful dart he can sustain;<br> Or Phœbus urged me to these fields in vain.”<br> So spoke he, boastful: but the winged dart<br>            Stopp’d short of life, and mock’d the shooter’s art.<br> The wounded chief, behind his car retired,<br> The helping hand of Sthenelus required;<br> Swift from his seat he leap’d upon the ground,<br> And tugg’d the weapon from the gushing wound;<br>            When thus the king his guardian power address’d,<br> The purple current wandering o’er his vest:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O progeny of Jove! unconquer’d maid!<br> If e’er my godlike sire deserved thy aid,<br> If e’er I felt thee in the fighting field;<br> Now, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.<br> O give my lance to reach the Trojan knight,<br> Whose arrow
            wounds the chief thou guard’st in fight;<br> And lay the boaster grovelling on the shore,<br> That vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus pray’d Tydides, and Minerva heard,<br> His nerves confirm’d, his languid spirits cheer’d;<br> He feels each limb with wonted vigour light;<br> His beating bosom claim’d the promised fight.<br> “Be bold, (she cried), in every combat shine,<br>            War be thy province, thy protection mine;<br> Rush to the fight, and every foe control;<br> Wake each paternal virtue in thy soul:<br> Strength swells thy boiling breast, infused by me,<br> And all thy godlike father breathes in thee;<br>            Yet more, from mortal mists I purge thy eyes,<a href="#fn145" name="fnref145"><sup>[145]</sup></a><br> And set to view the warring deities.<br> These see thou shun, through all the embattled plain;
            <br> Nor rashly strive where human force is vain.<br> If Venus mingle in the martial band,<br> Her shalt thou wound: so Pallas gives command.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            With that, the blue-eyed virgin wing’d her flight;<br> The hero rush’d impetuous to the fight;<br> With tenfold ardour now invades the plain,<br> Wild with delay, and more enraged by pain.<br> As on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls,<br>            Amidst the field a brindled lion falls;<br> If chance some shepherd with a distant dart<br> The savage wound, he rouses at the smart,<br> He foams, he roars; the shepherd dares not stay,<br> But trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey;<br>            Heaps fall on heaps; he bathes with blood the ground,<br> Then leaps victorious o’er the lofty mound.<br> Not with less fury stern Tydides flew;<br> And two brave leaders at an instant slew;<br> Astynous breathless fell, and by his side,<br>            His people’s pastor, good Hypenor, died;<br> Astynous’ breast the deadly lance receives,<br> Hypenor’s shoulder his broad falchion cleaves.<br> Those slain he left, and sprung with noble rage<br> Abas and Polyidus to engage;<br> Sons of Eurydamus,
            who, wise and old,<br> Could fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold;<br> The youths return’d not from the doubtful plain,<br> And the sad father tried his arts in vain;<br> No mystic dream could make their fates appear,<br> Though now determined
            by Tydides’ spear.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Young Xanthus next, and Thoon felt his rage;<br> The joy and hope of Phaenops’ feeble age:<br> Vast was his wealth, and these the only heirs<br> Of all his labours and a life of cares.<br> Cold death o’ertakes them in their blooming years,<br>            And leaves the father unavailing tears:<br> To strangers now descends his heapy store,<br> The race forgotten, and the name no more.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Two sons of Priam in one chariot ride,<br> Glittering in arms, and combat side by side.<br> As when the lordly lion seeks his food<br> Where grazing heifers range the lonely wood,<br> He leaps amidst them with a furious bound,<br> Bends their
            strong necks, and tears them to the ground:<br> So from their seats the brother chiefs are torn,<br> Their steeds and chariot to the navy borne.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            With deep concern divine Æneas view’d<br> The foe prevailing, and his friends pursued;<br> Through the thick storm of singing spears he flies,<br> Exploring Pandarus with careful eyes.<br> At length he found Lycaon’s mighty son;<br> To whom
            the chief of Venus’ race begun:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Where, Pandarus, are all thy honours now,<br> Thy winged arrows and unerring bow,<br> Thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall’d fame,<br> And boasted glory of the Lycian name?<br> O pierce that mortal! if we mortal call<br> That wondrous force
            by which whole armies fall;<br> Or god incensed, who quits the distant skies<br> To punish Troy for slighted sacrifice;<br> (Which, oh avert from our unhappy state!<br> For what so dreadful as celestial hate)?<br> Whoe’er he be, propitiate
            Jove with prayer;<br> If man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To him the Lycian: “Whom your eyes behold,<br> If right I judge, is Diomed the bold:<br> Such coursers whirl him o’er the dusty field,<br> So towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.<br> If ’tis a god, he wears that chief’s disguise:<br>            Or if that chief, some guardian of the skies,<br> Involved in clouds, protects him in the fray,<br> And turns unseen the frustrate dart away.<br> I wing’d an arrow, which not idly fell,<br> The stroke had fix’d him to the gates of hell;<br>            And, but some god, some angry god withstands,<br> His fate was due to these unerring hands.<br> Skill’d in the bow, on foot I sought the war,<br> Nor join’d swift horses to the rapid car.<br> Ten polish’d chariots I possess’d at home,<br>            And still they grace Lycaon’s princely dome:<br> There veil’d in spacious coverlets they stand;<br> And twice ten coursers wait their lord’s command.<br> The good old warrior bade me trust to these,<br> When first for Troy I sail’d the sacred
            seas;
            <br> In fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,<br> And through the ranks of death triumphant ride.<br> But vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined,<br> I heard his counsels with unheedful mind,<br> And thought the steeds (your large
            supplies unknown)<br> Might fail of forage in the straiten’d town;<br> So took my bow and pointed darts in hand<br> And left the chariots in my native land.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Too late, O friend! my rashness I deplore;<br> These shafts, once fatal, carry death no more.<br> Tydeus’ and Atreus’ sons their points have found,<br> And undissembled gore pursued the wound.<br> In vain they bleed: this unavailing bow<br>            Serves, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.<br> In evil hour these bended horns I strung,<br> And seized the quiver where it idly hung.<br> Cursed be the fate that sent me to the field<br> Without a warrior’s arms, the spear and shield!<br>            If e’er with life I quit the Trojan plain,<br> If e’er I see my spouse and sire again,<br> This bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims,<br> Broke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To whom the leader of the Dardan race:<br> “Be calm, nor Phœbus’ honour’d gift disgrace.<br> The distant dart be praised, though here we need<br> The rushing chariot and the bounding steed.<br> Against yon hero let us bend our course,<br>            And, hand to hand, encounter force with force.<br> Now mount my seat, and from the chariot’s height<br> Observe my father’s steeds, renown’d in fight;<br> Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,<br> To dare the shock, or urge the rapid
            race;
            <br> Secure with these, through fighting fields we go;<br> Or safe to Troy, if Jove assist the foe.<br> Haste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein;<br> The warrior’s fury let this arm sustain;<br> Or, if to combat thy bold heart incline,
            <br> Take thou the spear, the chariot’s care be mine.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O prince! (Lycaon’s valiant son replied)<br> As thine the steeds, be thine the task to guide.<br> The horses, practised to their lord’s command,<br> Shall bear the rein, and answer to thy hand;<br> But, if, unhappy, we desert the fight,<br>            Thy voice alone can animate their flight;<br> Else shall our fates be number’d with the dead,<br> And these, the victor’s prize, in triumph led.<br> Thine be the guidance, then: with spear and shield<br> Myself will charge this terror of the
            field.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            And now both heroes mount the glittering car;<br> The bounding coursers rush amidst the war;<br> Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied,<br> Who thus, alarm’d, to great Tydides cried:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O friend! two chiefs of force immense I see,<br> Dreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee:<br> Lo the brave heir of old Lycaon’s line,<br> And great Æneas, sprung from race divine!<br> Enough is given to fame. Ascend thy car!<br> And
            save a life, the bulwark of our war.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            At this the hero cast a gloomy look,<br> Fix’d on the chief with scorn; and thus he spoke:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?<br> Me wouldst thou move to base, inglorious flight?<br> Know, ’tis not honest in my soul to fear,<br> Nor was Tydides born to tremble here.<br> I hate the cumbrous chariot’s slow advance,<br> And
            the long distance of the flying lance;<br> But while my nerves are strong, my force entire,<br> Thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.<br> Nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey<br> Those threatening heroes, bear them both away;<br>            One chief at least beneath this arm shall die;<br> So Pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.<br> But if she dooms, and if no god withstand,<br> That both shall fall by one victorious hand,<br> Then heed my words: my horses here detain,<br> Fix’d
            to the chariot by the straiten’d rein;<br> Swift to Æneas’ empty seat proceed,<br> And seize the coursers of ethereal breed;<br> The race of those, which once the thundering god<a href="#fn146" name="fnref146"><sup>[146]</sup></a><br> For
            ravish’d Ganymede on Tros bestow’d,<br> The best that e’er on earth’s broad surface run,<br> Beneath the rising or the setting sun.<br> Hence great Anchises stole a breed unknown,<br> By mortal mares, from fierce Laomedon:<br> Four of this
            race his ample stalls contain,<br> And two transport Æneas o’er the plain.<br> These, were the rich immortal prize our own,<br> Through the wide world should make our glory known.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,<br> And stern Lycaon’s warlike race begun:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Prince, thou art met. Though late in vain assail’d,<br> The spear may enter where the arrow fail’d.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He said, then shook the ponderous lance, and flung;<br> On his broad shield the sounding weapon rung,<br> Pierced the tough orb, and in his cuirass hung,<br> “He bleeds! the pride of Greece! (the boaster cries,)<br> Our triumph now, the mighty
            warrior lies!”<br> “Mistaken vaunter! (Diomed replied;)<br> Thy dart has erred, and now my spear be tried;<br> Ye ’scape not both; one, headlong from his car,<br> With hostile blood shall glut the god of war.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He spoke, and rising hurl’d his forceful dart,<br> Which, driven by Pallas, pierced a vital part;<br> Full in his face it enter’d, and betwixt<br> The nose and eye-ball the proud Lycian fix’d;<br> Crash’d all his jaws, and cleft the tongue
            within,
            <br> Till the bright point look’d out beneath the chin.<br> Headlong he falls, his helmet knocks the ground:<br> Earth groans beneath him, and his arms resound;<br> The starting coursers tremble with affright;<br> The soul indignant seeks
            the realms of night.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To guard his slaughter’d friend, Æneas flies,<br> His spear extending where the carcase lies;<br> Watchful he wheels, protects it every way,<br> As the grim lion stalks around his prey.<br> O’er the fall’n trunk his ample shield display’d,<br>            He hides the hero with his mighty shade,<br> And threats aloud! the Greeks with longing eyes<br> Behold at distance, but forbear the prize.<br> Then fierce Tydides stoops; and from the fields<br> Heaved with vast force, a rocky fragment wields.<br>            Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,<br> Such men as live in these degenerate days:<a href="#fn147" name="fnref147"><sup>[147]</sup></a><br> He swung it round; and, gathering strength to throw,<br> Discharged the ponderous ruin
            at the foe.<br> Where to the hip the inserted thigh unites,<br> Full on the bone the pointed marble lights;<br> Through both the tendons broke the rugged stone,<br> And stripp’d the skin, and crack’d the solid bone.
            <br> Sunk on his knees, and staggering with his pains,<br> His falling bulk his bended arm sustains;<br> Lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies;<br> A sudden cloud comes swimming o’er his eyes.<br> There the brave chief, who mighty numbers
            sway’d,
            <br> Oppress’d had sunk to death’s eternal shade,<br> But heavenly Venus, mindful of the love<br> She bore Anchises in the Idaean grove,<br> His danger views with anguish and despair,<br> And guards her offspring with a mother’s care.<br>            About her much-loved son her arms she throws,<br> Her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows.<br> Screen’d from the foe behind her shining veil,<br> The swords wave harmless, and the javelins fail;<br> Safe through the rushing horse,
            and feather’d flight<br> Of sounding shafts, she bears him from the fight.
        </p>

            The gods having left the field, the Grecians prevail. Helenus, the chief augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to appoint a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the temple of Minerva, to entreat her to remove
            Diomed from the fight. The battle relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have an interview between the two armies; where, coming to the knowledge, of the friendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors, they make
            exchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of Helenus, prevails upon Paris to return to the battle, and, taking a tender leave of his wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is first in the field of battle, between the rivers Simois and Scamander, and then changes to Troy.

            the deathful plain<br> On either side, run purple to the main.

            smiled,
            <br> And Hector hasted to relieve his child,<br> The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,<br> And placed the beaming helmet on the ground;<br> Then kiss’d the child, and, lifting high in air,<br> Thus to the gods preferr’d a father’s
            prayer:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throne,<br> And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!<br> Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,<br> To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,<br> Against his country’s foes the war to wage,<br>            And rise the Hector of the future age!<br> So when triumphant from successful toils<br> Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,<br> Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,<br> And say, ‘This chief transcends his father’s fame:’<br>            While pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy,<br> His mother’s conscious heart o’erflows with joy.”

        <p class="verse">
            He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,<br> Restored the pleasing burden to her arms;<br> Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,<br> Hush’d to repose, and with a smile survey’d.<br> The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,<br>            She mingled with a smile a tender tear.<br> The soften’d chief with kind compassion view’d,<br> And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Andromache! my soul’s far better part,<br> Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?<br> No hostile hand can antedate my doom,<br> Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.<br> Fix’d is the term to all the race of earth;<br> And such the
            hard condition of our birth:<br> No force can then resist, no flight can save,<br> All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.<br> No more—but hasten to thy tasks at home,<br> There guide the spindle, and direct the loom:<br> Me glory summons
            to the martial scene,<br> The field of combat is the sphere for men.<br> Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim,<br> The first in danger as the first in fame.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes<br> His towery helmet, black with shading plumes.<br> His princess parts with a prophetic sigh,<br> Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye<br> That stream’d at every look; then, moving slow,<br>            Sought her own palace, and indulged her woe.<br> There, while her tears deplored the godlike man,<br> Through all her train the soft infection ran;<br> The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed,<br> And mourn the living Hector, as the dead.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            But now, no longer deaf to honour’s call,<br> Forth issues Paris from the palace wall.<br> In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray,<br> Swift through the town the warrior bends his way.<br> The wanton courser thus with reins unbound<a href="#fn176"

        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            And now, the warriors passing on the way,<br> The graceful Paris first excused his stay.<br> To whom the noble Hector thus replied:<br> “O chief! in blood, and now in arms, allied!<br> Thy power in war with justice none contest;<br> Known

            ARGUMENT
        </p>

        <p class="center">
            THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector, Minerva is under apprehensions for the Greeks. Apollo, seeing her descend from Olympus, joins her near the Scaean gate. They agree to put off the general engagement for that day, and incite
            Hector to challenge the Greeks to a single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the challenge, the lot is cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after several attacks, are parted by the night. The Trojans calling a council, Antenor purposes
            the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which Paris will not consent, but offers to restore them her riches. Priam sends a herald to make this offer, and to demand a truce for burning the dead, the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon.
            When the funerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor, erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies his jealousy at this work,
            but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans with thunder, and other signs of his wrath.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three and twentieth day ends with
            the duel of Hector and Ajax, the next day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the funeral rites of the slain and one more in building the fortification before the ships. So that somewhat about three days is employed in this book. The
            scene lies wholly in the field.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state,<br> Then rush’d impetuous through the Scaean gate.<br> Him Paris follow’d to the dire alarms;<br> Both breathing slaughter, both resolved in arms.<br> As when to sailors labouring through the main,<br>            That long have heaved the weary oar in vain,<br> Jove bids at length the expected gales arise;<br> The gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies.<br> So welcome these to Troy’s desiring train,<br> The bands are cheer’d, the war awakes again.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Bold Paris first the work of death begun<br> On great Menestheus, Areithous’ son,<br> Sprung from the fair Philomeda’s embrace,<br> The pleasing Arne was his native place.<br> Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below,<br> Beneath his steely casque
            <a href="#fn177" name="fnref177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> he felt the blow<br> Full on his neck, from Hector’s weighty hand;<br> And roll’d, with limbs relax’d, along the land.<br> By Glaucus’ spear the bold Iphinous bleeds,
            <br> Fix’d in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;<br> Headlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unbound,<br> Drop the cold useless members on the ground.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            When now Minerva saw her Argives slain,<br> From vast Olympus to the gleaming plain<br> Fierce she descends: Apollo marked her flight,<br> Nor shot less swift from Ilion’s towery height.<br> Radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade;<br>            When thus Apollo to the blue-eyed maid:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “What cause, O daughter of Almighty Jove!<br> Thus wings thy progress from the realms above?<br> Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way,<br> To give to Greece the long divided day?<br> Too much has Troy already felt thy hate,<br> Now breathe
            thy rage, and hush the stern debate;<br> This day, the business of the field suspend;<br> War soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend;<br> Since vengeful goddesses confederate join<br> To raze her walls, though built by hands divine.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To whom the progeny of Jove replies:<br> “I left, for this, the council of the skies:<br> But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear,<br> What art shall calm the furious sons of war?”<br> To her the god: “Great Hector’s soul incite<br> To
            dare the boldest Greek to single fight,<br> Till Greece, provoked, from all her numbers show<br> A warrior worthy to be Hector’s foe.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            At this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew;<br> Sage Helenus their secret counsels knew;<br> Hector, inspired, he sought: to him address’d,<br> Thus told the dictates of his sacred breast:<br> “O son of Priam! let thy faithful ear<br> Receive
            my words: thy friend and brother hear!<br> Go forth persuasive, and a while engage<br> The warring nations to suspend their rage;<br> Then dare the boldest of the hostile train<br> To mortal combat on the listed plain.<br> For not this day
            shall end thy glorious date;<br> The gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He said: the warrior heard the word with joy;<br> Then with his spear restrain’d the youth of Troy,<br> Held by the midst athwart. On either hand<br> The squadrons part; the expecting Trojans stand;<br> Great Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear:<br>            They breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.<br> The Athenian maid,<a href="#fn178" name="fnref178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> and glorious god of day,<br> With silent joy the settling hosts survey:
            <br> In form of vultures, on the beech’s height<br> They sit conceal’d, and wait the future fight.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,<br> Horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.<br> As when a general darkness veils the main,<br> (Soft Zephyr curling the wide wat’ry plain,)<br> The waves scarce heave, the face of
            ocean sleeps,<br> And a still horror saddens all the deeps;<br> Thus in thick orders settling wide around,<br> At length composed they sit, and shade the ground.<br> Great Hector first amidst both armies broke<br> The solemn silence, and their
            powers bespoke:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,<br> What my soul prompts, and what some god commands.<br> Great Jove, averse our warfare to compose,<br> O’erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes;<br> War with a fiercer tide once more returns,<br>            Till Ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.<br> You then, O princes of the Greeks! appear;<br> ’Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear:<br> From all your troops select the boldest knight,<br> And him, the boldest, Hector dares to fight.<br>            Here if I fall, by chance of battle slain,<br> Be his my spoil, and his these arms remain;<br> But let my body, to my friends return’d,<br> By Trojan hands and Trojan flames be burn’d.<br> And if Apollo, in whose aid I trust,<br> Shall stretch
            your daring champion in the dust;<br> If mine the glory to despoil the foe;<br> On Phœbus’ temple I’ll his arms bestow:<br> The breathless carcase to your navy sent,<br> Greece on the shore shall raise a monument;<br> Which when some future
            mariner surveys,<br> Wash’d by broad Hellespont’s resounding seas,<br> Thus shall he say, ‘A valiant Greek lies there,<br> By Hector slain, the mighty man of war,’<br> The stone shall tell your vanquish’d hero’s name<br> And distant ages learn
            the victor’s fame.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            This fierce defiance Greece astonish’d heard,<br> Blush’d to refuse, and to accept it fear’d.<br> Stern Menelaus first the silence broke,<br> And, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Women of Greece! O scandal of your race,<br> Whose coward souls your manly form disgrace,<br> How great the shame, when every age shall know<br> That not a Grecian met this noble foe!<br> Go then! resolve to earth, from whence ye grew,<br>            A heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!<br> Be what ye seem, unanimated clay,<br> Myself will dare the danger of the day;<br> ’Tis man’s bold task the generous strife to try,<br> But in the hands of God is victory.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            These words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press’d,<br> His manly limbs in azure arms he dress’d.<br> That day, Atrides! a superior hand<br> Had stretch’d thee breathless on the hostile strand;<br> But all at once, thy fury to compose,<br>            The kings of Greece, an awful band, arose;<br> Even he their chief, great Agamemnon, press’d<br> Thy daring hand, and this advice address’d:<br> “Whither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run,<br> And tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?<br>            Grieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;<br> Great Hector’s arm is mightier far than thine:<br> Even fierce Achilles learn’d its force to fear,<br> And trembling met this dreadful son of war.<br> Sit thou secure, amidst thy social
            band;
            <br> Greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.<br> The mightiest warrior of the Achaian name,<br> Though bold and burning with desire of fame,<br> Content the doubtful honour might forego,<br> So great the danger, and so brave the
            foe.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He said, and turn’d his brother’s vengeful mind;<br> He stoop’d to reason, and his rage resign’d,<br> No longer bent to rush on certain harms;<br> His joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He from whose lips divine persuasion flows,<br> Grave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose;<br> Thus to the kings he spoke: “What grief, what shame<br> Attend on Greece, and all the Grecian name!<br> How shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn<br>            Their sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!<br> What tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll’d,<br> O Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!<br> Once with what joy the generous prince would hear<br> Of every chief who fought this glorious
            war,
            <br> Participate their fame, and pleased inquire<br> Each name, each action, and each hero’s sire!<br> Gods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,<br> And trembling all before one hostile hand;<br> How would he lift his aged arms on
            high,
            <br> Lament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!<br> Oh! would to all the immortal powers above,<br> Minerva, Phœbus, and almighty Jove!<br> Years might again roll back, my youth renew,<br> And give this arm the spring which once it knew
            <br> When fierce in war, where Jardan’s waters fall,<br> I led my troops to Phea’s trembling wall,<br> And with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried,<br> Where Celadon rolls down his rapid tide.<a href="#fn179" name="fnref179"><sup>[179]</sup></a><br>            There Ereuthalion braved us in the field,<br> Proud Areithous’ dreadful arms to wield;<br> Great Areithous, known from shore to shore<br> By the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;<br> No lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,<br> But broke,
            with this, the battle of the foe.<br> Him not by manly force Lycurgus slew,<br> Whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,<br> Deep in a winding way his breast assailed,<br> Nor aught the warrior’s thundering mace avail’d.<br> Supine he
            fell: those arms which Mars before<br> Had given the vanquish’d, now the victor bore:<br> But when old age had dimm’d Lycurgus’ eyes,<br> To Ereuthalion he consign’d the prize.<br> Furious with this he crush’d our levell’d bands,<br> And dared
            the trial of the strongest hands;<br> Nor could the strongest hands his fury stay:<br> All saw, and fear’d, his huge tempestuous sway<br> Till I, the youngest of the host, appear’d,<br> And, youngest, met whom all our army fear’d.<br> I fought
            the chief: my arms Minerva crown’d:<br> Prone fell the giant o’er a length of ground.<br> What then I was, O were your Nestor now!<br> Not Hector’s self should want an equal foe.<br> But, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,<br> The flower
            of Greece, the examples of our host,<br> Sprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,<br> Can you stand trembling, and desert the day?”

        <p class="verse">
            His warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;<br> And nine, the noblest of the Grecian name,<br> Up-started fierce: but far before the rest<br> The king of men advanced his dauntless breast:<br> Then bold Tydides, great in arms, appear’d;<br>            And next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear’d;<br> Oïleus follow’d; Idomen was there,<a href="#fn180" name="fnref180"><sup>[180]</sup></a><br> And Merion, dreadful as the god of war:<br> With these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,

            warlike Salamis I drew my birth,<br> And, born to combats, fear no force on earth.”

            He said. The troops with elevated eyes,<br> Implore the god whose thunder rends the skies:<br> “O father of mankind, superior lord!<br> On lofty Ida’s holy hill adored:<br> Who in the highest heaven hast fix’d thy throne,<br> Supreme of gods!
            unbounded and alone:<br> Grant thou, that Telamon may bear away<br> The praise and conquest of this doubtful day;<br> Or, if illustrious Hector be thy care,<br> That both may claim it, and that both may share.”

        <p class="verse">
            Now Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;<br> Sheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:<br> He moves to combat with majestic pace;<br> So stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,<a href="#fn182" name="fnref182"><sup>[182]</sup></a><br>            When Jove to punish faithless men prepares,<br> And gives whole nations to the waste of wars,<br> Thus march’d the chief, tremendous as a god;<br> Grimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:<a href="#fn183" name="fnref183"><sup>[183]</sup></a><br>            His massy javelin quivering in his hand,<br> He stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.<br> Through every Argive heart new transport ran;<br> All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:<br> Even Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress’d,<br>            Felt his great heart suspended in his breast:<br> ’Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;<br> Himself had challenged, and the foe drew near.

        <p class="verse">
            “Hector! approach my arm, and singly know<br> What strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.<br> Achilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,<br> Not void of soul, and not unskill’d in war:<br> Let him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,<br>            Indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;<br> Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,<br> And sends thee one, a sample of her host,<br> Such as I am, I come to prove thy might;<br> No more—be sudden, and begin the fight.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O son of Telamon, thy country’s pride!<br> (To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)<br> Me, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,<br> New to the field, and trembling at the fight?<br> Thou meet’st a chief deserving of thy arms,<br> To
            combat born, and bred amidst alarms:<br> I know to shift my ground, remount the car,<br> Turn, charge, and answer every call of war;<br> To right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,<br> And bear thick battle on my sounding shield/<br> But

            blow.
            <br> From their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,<br> Then close impetuous, and the charge renew;<br> Fierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,<br> Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.<br> At Ajax, Hector his long lance

            <br> The blunted point against the buckler bends;<br> But Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,<br> Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;<br> It reach’d his neck, with matchless strength impell’d!<br> Spouts the black gore, and dims
            his shining shield.<br> Yet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,<br> In his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,<br> Black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;<br> Full on the brazen boss the stone descends;<br> The hollow brass
            resounded with the shock:<br> Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,<br> Applied each nerve, and swinging round on high,<br> With force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;<br> The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:<br> His slacken’d
            knees received the numbing stroke;<br> Great Hector falls extended on the field,<br> His bulk supporting on the shatter’d shield:<br> Nor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo’s might<br> Confirm’d his sinews, and restored to fight.<br> And now both

        <p class="verse">
            Meanwhile, convened at Priam’s palace-gate,<br> The Trojan peers in nightly council sate;<br> A senate void of order, as of choice:<br> Their hearts were fearful, and confused their voice.<br> Antenor, rising, thus demands their ear:<br> “Ye

            express the purpose of thy heart,<br> Thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given;<br> But wisdom has its date, assign’d by heaven.<br> Then hear me, princes of the Trojan name!<br> Their treasures I’ll restore, but not the dame;<br> My

            The monarch spoke: the warriors snatch’d with haste<br> (Each at his post in arms) a short repast.<br> Soon as the rosy morn had waked the day,<br> To the black ships Idaeus bent his way;<br> There, to the sons of Mars, in council found,<br>            He raised his voice: the host stood listening round.

        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The Greeks gave ear, but none the silence broke;<br> At length Tydides rose, and rising spoke:<br> “Oh, take not, friends! defrauded of your fame,<br> Their proffer’d wealth, nor even the Spartan dame.<br> Let conquest make them ours: fate
            shakes their wall,<br> And Troy already totters to her fall.”

        <p class="verse">
            The admiring chiefs, and all the Grecian name,<br> With general shouts return’d him loud acclaim.<br> Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace:<br> “Herald! in him thou hear’st the voice of Greece<br> For what remains; let funeral flames
            be fed<br> With heroes’ corps: I war not with the dead:<br> Go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain,<br> And gratify the manes of the slain.<br> Be witness, Jove, whose thunder rolls on high!”<br> He said, and rear’d his sceptre
            to the sky.

        <p class="verse">
            To sacred Troy, where all her princes lay<br> To wait the event, the herald bent his way.<br> He came, and standing in the midst, explain’d<br> The peace rejected, but the truce obtain’d.<br> Straight to their several cares the Trojans move,<br>            Some search the plains, some fell the sounding grove:<br> Nor less the Greeks, descending on the shore,<br> Hew’d the green forests, and the bodies bore.<br> And now from forth the chambers of the main,<br> To shed his sacred light on earth
            again,
            <br> Arose the golden chariot of the day,<br> And tipp’d the mountains with a purple ray.<br> In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train<br> Through heaps of carnage search’d the mournful plain.<br> Scarce could the friend his slaughter’d
            friend explore,<br> With dust dishonour’d, and deformed with gore.<br> The wounds they wash’d, their pious tears they shed,<br> And, laid along their cars, deplored the dead.<br> Sage Priam check’d their grief: with silent haste<br> The bodies
            decent on the piles were placed:<br> With melting hearts the cold remains they burn’d,<br> And, sadly slow, to sacred Troy return’d.<br> Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed,<br> And decent on the pile dispose the dead;<br> The cold
            remains consume with equal care;<br> And slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.<br> Now, ere the morn had streak’d with reddening light<br> The doubtful confines of the day and night,<br> About the dying flames the Greeks appear’d,<br> And
            round the pile a general tomb they rear’d.<br> Then, to secure the camp and naval powers,<br> They raised embattled walls with lofty towers:<a href="#fn186" name="fnref186"><sup>[186]</sup></a><br> From space to space were ample gates around,<br>            For passing chariots, and a trench profound<br> Of large extent; and deep in earth below,<br> Strong piles infix’d stood adverse to the foe.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            So toil’d the Greeks: meanwhile the gods above,<br> In shining circle round their father Jove,<br> Amazed beheld the wondrous works of man:<br> Then he, whose trident shakes the earth, began:

            razed and lost, in long oblivion sleep.”<br> Thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The almighty Thunderer with a frown replies,<br> That clouds the world, and blackens half the skies:<br> “Strong god of ocean! thou, whose rage can make<br> The solid earth’s eternal basis shake!<br> What cause of fear from mortal works could

            Jupiter assembles a council of the deities, and threatens them with the pains of Tartarus if they assist either side: Minerva only obtains of him that she may direct the Greeks by her counsels. The armies join battle: Jupiter on Mount Ida weighs in his
            balances the fates of both, and affrights the Greeks with his thunders and lightnings. Nestor alone continues in the field in great danger: Diomed relieves him; whose exploits, and those of Hector, are excellently described. Juno endeavours
            to animate Neptune to the assistance of the Greeks, but in vain. The acts of Teucer, who is at length wounded by Hector, and carried off. Juno and Minerva prepare to aid the Grecians, but are restrained by Iris, sent from Jupiter. The night
            puts an end to the battle. Hector continues in the field, (the Greeks being driven to their fortifications before the ships,) and gives orders to keep the watch all night in the camp, to prevent the enemy from re-embarking and escaping by
            flight. They kindle fires through all the fields, and pass the night under arms.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of the poem to the end of this book. The scene here (except
            of the celestial machines) lies in the field towards the seashore.

        <p class="verse">
            The victors keep the field; and Hector calls<br> A martial council near the navy walls;<br> These to Scamander’s bank apart he led,<br> Where thinly scatter’d lay the heaps of dead.<br> The assembled chiefs, descending on the ground,<br> Attend

            token of the Phrygian foe,<br> Wounds, that long hence may ask their spouses’ care.<br> And warn their children from a Trojan war.<br> Now through the circuit of our Ilion wall,<br> Let sacred heralds sound the solemn call;<br> To bid the
            sires with hoary honours crown’d,<br> And beardless youths, our battlements surround.<br> Firm be the guard, while distant lie our powers,<br> And let the matrons hang with lights the towers;<br> Lest, under covert of the midnight shade,<br>            The insidious foe the naked town invade.<br> Suffice, to-night, these orders to obey;<br> A nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day.<br> The gods, I trust, shall give to Hector’s hand<br> From these detested foes to free the land,<br> Who

        <p class="center">
            THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            Agamemnon, after the last day’s defeat, proposes to the Greeks to quit the siege, and return to their country. Diomed opposes this, and Nestor seconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to be strengthened, and a council summoned
            to deliberate what measures are to be followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and Nestor further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in order to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice
            of, who are accompanied by old Phœnix. They make, each of them, very moving and pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by Achilles, who notwithstanding retains Phœnix in his tent. The ambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp,
            and the troops betake themselves to sleep.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book, and the next following, take up the space of one night, which is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The scene lies on the sea-shore,
            the station of the Grecian ships.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus joyful Troy maintain’d the watch of night;<br> While fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,<a href="#fn199" name="fnref199"><sup>[199]</sup></a><br> And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,<br> Sat on each face, and sadden’d every
            heart.
            <br> As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,<br> A double tempest of the west and north<br> Swells o’er the sea, from Thracia’s frozen shore,<br> Heaps waves on waves, and bids the Ægean roar:<br> This way and that the boiling deeps are
            toss’d:<br> Such various passions urged the troubled host,<br> Great Agamemnon grieved above the rest;<br> Superior sorrows swell’d his royal breast;<br> Himself his orders to the heralds bears,<br> To bid to council all the Grecian peers,<br>            But bid in whispers: these surround their chief,<br> In solemn sadness and majestic grief.<br> The king amidst the mournful circle rose:<br> Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.
            <br> So silent fountains, from a rock’s tall head,<br> In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.<br> With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress’d;<br> Words, mix’d with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader’s care;<br> Fellows in arms and princes of the war!<br> Of partial Jove too justly we complain,<br> And heavenly oracles believed in vain.<br> A safe return was promised to our toils,<br> With conquest
            honour’d and enrich’d with spoils:<br> Now shameful flight alone can save the host;<br> Our wealth, our people, and our glory lost.<br> So Jove decrees, almighty lord of all!<br> Jove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,<br> Who shakes
            the feeble props of human trust,<br> And towers and armies humbles to the dust.<br> Haste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,<br> Haste to the joys our native country yields;<br> Spread all your canvas, all your oars employ,<br> Nor hope
            the fall of heaven-defended Troy.”

        <p class="verse">
            He said: deep silence held the Grecian band;<br> Silent, unmov’d in dire dismay they stand;<br> A pensive scene! till Tydeus’ warlike son<br> Roll’d on the king his eyes, and thus begun:<br> “When kings advise us to renounce our fame,<br>            First let him speak who first has suffer’d shame.<br> If I oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,<br> The laws of council bid my tongue be bold.<br> Thou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,<br> Durst brand my courage, and defame my
            might:
            <br> Nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear’d,<br> The Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.<br> The gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,<br> The gods have made thee but by halves a king:<br> They gave thee sceptres, and
            a wide command;<br> They gave dominion o’er the seas and land;<br> The noblest power that might the world control<br> They gave thee not—a brave and virtuous soul.<br> Is this a general’s voice, that would suggest<br> Fears like his own to
            every Grecian breast?<br> Confiding in our want of worth, he stands;<br> And if we fly, ’tis what our king commands.<br> Go thou, inglorious! from the embattled plain;<br> Ships thou hast store, and nearest to the main;<br> A noble care the
            Grecians shall employ,<br> To combat, conquer, and extirpate Troy.<br> Here Greece shall stay; or, if all Greece retire,<br> Myself shall stay, till Troy or I expire;<br> Myself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame;<br> God bade us fight, and
            ’twas with God we came.”

            He ceased; the Greeks loud acclamations raise,<br> And voice to voice resounds Tydides’ praise.<br> Wise Nestor then his reverend figure rear’d;<br> He spoke: the host in still attention heard:<a href="#fn200" name="fnref200"><sup>[200]</sup></a>

            “O truly great! in whom the gods have join’d<br> Such strength of body with such force of mind:<br> In conduct, as in courage, you excel,<br> Still first to act what you advise so well.<br> These wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves,<br>            Applauding Greece with common voice approves.<br> Kings thou canst blame; a bold but prudent youth:<br> And blame even kings with praise, because with truth.<br> And yet those years that since thy birth have run<br> Would hardly style thee
            Nestor’s youngest son.<br> Then let me add what yet remains behind,<br> A thought unfinish’d in that generous mind;<br> Age bids me speak! nor shall the advice I bring<br> Distaste the people, or offend the king:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Cursed is the man, and void of law and right,<br> Unworthy property, unworthy light,<br> Unfit for public rule, or private care,<br> That wretch, that monster, who delights in war;<br> Whose lust is murder, and whose horrid joy,<br> To tear
            his country, and his kind destroy!<br> This night, refresh and fortify thy train;<br> Between the trench and wall let guards remain:<br> Be that the duty of the young and bold;<br> But thou, O king, to council call the old;<br> Great is thy
            sway, and weighty are thy cares;<br> Thy high commands must spirit all our wars.<br> With Thracian wines recruit thy honour’d guests,<br> For happy counsels flow from sober feasts.<br> Wise, weighty counsels aid a state distress’d,<br> And
            such a monarch as can choose the best.<br> See what a blaze from hostile tents aspires,<br> How near our fleet approach the Trojan fires!<br> Who can, unmoved, behold the dreadful light?<br> What eye beholds them, and can close to-night?<br>            This dreadful interval determines all;<br> To-morrow, Troy must flame, or Greece must fall.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus spoke the hoary sage: the rest obey;<br> Swift through the gates the guards direct their way.<br> His son was first to pass the lofty mound,<br> The generous Thrasymed, in arms renown’d:<br> Next him, Ascalaphus, Ialmen, stood,<br> The
            double offspring of the warrior-god:<br> Deipyrus, Aphareus, Merion join,<br> And Lycomed of Creon’s noble line.<br> Seven were the leaders of the nightly bands,<br> And each bold chief a hundred spears commands.<br> The fires they light,
            to short repasts they fall,<br> Some line the trench, and others man the wall.

            The king of men, on public counsels bent,<br> Convened the princes in his ample tent,<br> Each seized a portion of the kingly feast,<br> But stay’d his hand when thirst and hunger ceased.<br> Then Nestor spoke, for wisdom long approved,<br>            And slowly rising, thus the council moved.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Monarch of nations! whose superior sway<br> Assembled states, and lords of earth obey,<br> The laws and sceptres to thy hand are given,<br> And millions own the care of thee and Heaven.<br> O king! the counsels of my age attend;<br> With

            the terms we bring,<br> Were rage still harbour’d in the haughty king;<br> Nor Greece nor all her fortunes should engage<br> Thy friend to plead against so just a rage.<br> But since what honour asks the general sends,
            <br> And sends by those whom most thy heart commends;<br> The best and noblest of the Grecian train;<br> Permit not these to sue, and sue in vain!<br> Let me (my son) an ancient fact unfold,<br> A great example drawn from times of old;<br>            Hear what our fathers were, and what their praise,<br> Who conquer’d their revenge in former days.

            THE NIGHT-ADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army, the distress of Agamemnon is described in the most lively manner. He takes no rest that night, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving all possible methods for the public safety.
            Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses, and Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call a council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemies’ camp, to learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed undertakes
            this hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for his companion. In their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had sent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are informed of the situation of the Trojan and
            auxiliary forces, and particularly of Rhesus, and the Thracians who were lately arrived. They pass on with success; kill Rhesus, with several of his officers, and seize the famous horses of that prince, with which they return in triumph to
            the camp.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            All night the chiefs before their vessels lay,<br> And lost in sleep the labours of the day:<br> All but the king: with various thoughts oppress’d,<a href="#fn215" name="fnref215"><sup>[215]</sup></a><br> His country’s cares lay rolling in
            his breast.<br> As when by lightnings Jove’s ethereal power<br> Foretels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,<br> Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,<br> Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar;<br> By fits one flash succeeds as
            one expires,<br> And heaven flames thick with momentary fires:<br> So bursting frequent from Atrides’ breast,<br> Sighs following sighs his inward fears confess’d.<br> Now o’er the fields, dejected, he surveys<br> From thousand Trojan fires
            the mounting blaze;<br> Hears in the passing wind their music blow,<br> And marks distinct the voices of the foe.<br> Now looking backwards to the fleet and coast,<br> Anxious he sorrows for the endangered host.<br> He rends his hair, in sacrifice
            to Jove,<br> And sues to him that ever lives above:<br> Inly he groans; while glory and despair<br> Divide his heart, and wage a double war.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            A thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;<br> To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves,<br> With him, in wholesome counsels, to debate<br> What yet remains to save the afflicted state.<br> He rose, and first he cast his mantle round,<br>            Next on his feet the shining sandals bound;<br> A lion’s yellow spoils his back conceal’d;<br> His warlike hand a pointed javelin held.<br> Meanwhile his brother, press’d with equal woes,<br> Alike denied the gifts of soft repose,<br> Laments
            for Greece, that in his cause before<br> So much had suffer’d and must suffer more.<br> A leopard’s spotted hide his shoulders spread:<br> A brazen helmet glitter’d on his head:<br> Thus (with a javelin in his hand) he went<br> To wake Atrides
            in the royal tent.<br> Already waked, Atrides he descried,<br> His armour buckling at his vessel’s side.<br> Joyful they met; the Spartan thus begun:<br> “Why puts my brother his bright armour on?<br> Sends he some spy, amidst these silent
            hours,
            <br> To try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?<br> But say, what hero shall sustain that task?<br> Such bold exploits uncommon courage ask;<br> Guideless, alone, through night’s dark shade to go,<br> And midst a hostile camp explore the
            foe.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To whom the king: “In such distress we stand,<br> No vulgar counsel our affairs demand;<br> Greece to preserve, is now no easy part,<br> But asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.<br> For Jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,<br> And bows
            his head to Hector’s sacrifice.<br> What eye has witness’d, or what ear believed,<br> In one great day, by one great arm achieved,<br> Such wondrous deeds as Hector’s hand has done,<br> And we beheld, the last revolving sun?<br> What honours
            the beloved of Jove adorn!<br> Sprung from no god, and of no goddess born;<br> Yet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,<br> And curse the battle where their fathers fell.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,<br> There call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;<br> Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair;<br> To keep the guards on duty be his care,<br> (For Nestor’s influence best that quarter guides,<br>            Whose son with Merion, o’er the watch presides.”)<br> To whom the Spartan: “These thy orders borne,<br> Say, shall I stay, or with despatch return?”<br> “There shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)<br> Else may we miss to meet, without
            a guide,<br> The paths so many, and the camp so wide.<br> Still, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,<br> Urge by their fathers’ fame their future praise.<br> Forget we now our state and lofty birth;<br> Not titles here, but works,
            must prove our worth.<br> To labour is the lot of man below;<br> And when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            This said, each parted to his several cares:<br> The king to Nestor’s sable ship repairs;<br> The sage protector of the Greeks he found<br> Stretch’d in his bed with all his arms around;<br> The various-colour’d scarf, the shield he rears,<br>            The shining helmet, and the pointed spears;<br> The dreadful weapons of the warrior’s rage,<br> That, old in arms, disdain’d the peace of age.<br> Then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,<br> The hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,<br> While others sleep, thus range the camp alone;<br> Seek’st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?<br> Stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O son of Neleus, (thus the king rejoin’d,)<br> Pride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind!<br> Lo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands,<br> The unhappy general of the Grecian bands,<br> Whom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend,<br> And woes,
            that only with his life shall end!<br> Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,<br> And scarce my heart support its load of pain.<br> No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,<br> Confused, and sad, I wander thus alone,<br>            With fears distracted, with no fix’d design;<br> And all my people’s miseries are mine.<br> If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,<br> (Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)<br> Impart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;<br>            Now let us jointly to the trench descend,<br> At every gate the fainting guard excite,<br> Tired with the toils of day and watch of night;<br> Else may the sudden foe our works invade,<br> So near, and favour’d by the gloomy shade.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To him thus Nestor: “Trust the powers above,<br> Nor think proud Hector’s hopes confirm’d by Jove:<br> How ill agree the views of vain mankind,<br> And the wise counsels of the eternal mind!<br> Audacious Hector, if the gods ordain<br> That
            great Achilles rise and rage again,<br> What toils attend thee, and what woes remain!<br> Lo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;<br> The care is next our other chiefs to raise:<br> Ulysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;<br> Meges for strength,
            Oileus famed for speed.<br> Some other be despatch’d of nimbler feet,<br> To those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,<br> Where lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.<a href="#fn216" name="fnref216"><sup>[216]</sup></a><br> To rouse the Spartan
            I myself decree;<br> Dear as he is to us, and dear to thee,<br> Yet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share<br> With his great brother in his martial care:<br> Him it behoved to every chief to sue,<br> Preventing every part perform’d by
            you;
            <br> For strong necessity our toils demands,<br> Claims all our hearts, and urges all our hands.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To whom the king: “With reverence we allow<br> Thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:<br> My generous brother is of gentle kind,<br> He seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;<br> Through too much deference to our sovereign sway,<br>            Content to follow when we lead the way:<br> But now, our ills industrious to prevent,<br> Long ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.<br> The chiefs you named, already at his call,<br> Prepare to meet us near the navy-wall;<br> Assembling
            there, between the trench and gates,<br> Near the night-guards, our chosen council waits.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Then none (said Nestor) shall his rule withstand,<br> For great examples justify command.”<br> With that, the venerable warrior rose;<br> The shining greaves his manly legs enclose;<br> His purple mantle golden buckles join’d,<br> Warm with
            the softest wool, and doubly lined.<br> Then rushing from his tent, he snatch’d in haste<br> His steely lance, that lighten’d as he pass’d.<br> The camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,<br> Stopp’d at Ulysses’ tent, and call’d aloud.<br>            Ulysses, sudden as the voice was sent,<br> Awakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.<br> “What new distress, what sudden cause of fright,<br> Thus leads you wandering in the silent night?”<br> “O prudent chief! (the Pylian sage replied)<br>            Wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:<br> Whatever means of safety can be sought,<br> Whatever counsels can inspire our thought,<br> Whatever methods, or to fly or fight;<br> All, all depend on this important night!”<br> He heard, return’d,
            and took his painted shield;<br> Then join’d the chiefs, and follow’d through the field.<br> Without his tent, bold Diomed they found,<br> All sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:<br> Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,<br>            His head reclining on his bossy shield.<br> A wood of spears stood by, that, fix’d upright,<br> Shot from their flashing points a quivering light.<br> A bull’s black hide composed the hero’s bed;<br> A splendid carpet roll’d beneath his head.<br>            Then, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes<br> The slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Rise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong<br> Rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.<br> But sleep’st thou now, when from yon hill the foe<br> Hangs o’er the fleet, and shades our walls below?”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            At this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;<br> The warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:<br> “Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,<br> Though years and honours bid thee seek repose,<br> Let younger Greeks our sleeping warriors
            wake;
            <br> Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake.”<br> “My friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;<br> These toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;<br> Their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire<br> To ease a sovereign and relieve
            a sire:<br> But now the last despair surrounds our host;<br> No hour must pass, no moment must be lost;<br> Each single Greek, in this conclusive strife,<br> Stands on the sharpest edge of death or life:<br> Yet, if my years thy kind regard
            engage,
            <br> Employ thy youth as I employ my age;<br> Succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;<br> He serves me most, who serves his country best.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            This said, the hero o’er his shoulders flung<br> A lion’s spoils, that to his ankles hung;<br> Then seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.<br> Meges the bold, with Ajax famed for speed,<br> The warrior roused, and to the entrenchments
            lead.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            And now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;<br> A wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:<br> The unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,<br> And, couching close, repel invading sleep.<br> So faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,<br>            With toil protected from the prowling train;<br> When the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,<br> Springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold:<br> Through breaking woods her rustling course they hear;<br> Loud, and more loud, the clamours
            strike their ear<br> Of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,<br> Watch every side, and turn to every sound.<br> Thus watch’d the Grecians, cautious of surprise,<br> Each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:<br> Each step

        <p class="verse">
            “Is there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,<br> His life to hazard, and his country save?<br> Lives there a man, who singly dares to go<br> To yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?<br> Or favour’d by the night approach so near,<br>            Their speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?<br> If to besiege our navies they prepare,<br> Or Troy once more must be the seat of war?<br> This could he learn, and to our peers recite,<br> And pass unharm’d the dangers of the night;<br>            What fame were his through all succeeding days,<br> While Phœbus shines, or men have tongues to praise!<br> What gifts his grateful country would bestow!<br> What must not Greece to her deliverer owe?<br> A sable ewe each leader should provide,<br>            With each a sable lambkin by her side;<br> At every rite his share should be increased,<br> And his the foremost honours of the feast.”

        <p class="verse">
            Fear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,<br> Tydides spoke—“The man you seek is here.<br> Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,<br> Some god within commands, and I obey.<br> But let some other chosen warrior join,<br> To raise

            great Ulysses wish’d, nor wish’d in vain.<br> Then thus the king of men the contest ends:<br> “Thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,<br> Undaunted Diomed! what chief to join<br> In this great enterprise, is only thine.<br> Just

        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin’d)<br> My choice declares the impulse of my mind.<br> How can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands<br> To lend his counsels and assist our hands?<br> A chief, whose safety is Minerva’s care;<br> So famed,
            so dreadful, in the works of war:<br> Bless’d in his conduct, I no aid require;<br> Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire.”

            Thus having spoke, with generous ardour press’d,<br> In arms terrific their huge limbs they dress’d.<br> A two-edged falchion Thrasymed the brave,<br> And ample buckler, to Tydides gave:<br> Then in a leathern helm he cased his head,<br> Short

        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then godlike Diomed preferr’d his prayer:<br> “Daughter of Jove, unconquer’d Pallas! hear.<br> Great queen of arms, whose favour Tydeus won,<br> As thou defend’st the sire, defend the son.<br> When on Æsopus’ banks the banded powers<br> Of

        <p class="verse">
            A youth there was among the tribes of Troy,<br> Dolon his name, Eumedes’ only boy,<br> (Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)<br> Rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;<br> Not bless’d by nature with the charms of face,<br> But

        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,<br> Attesting thus the monarch of the sky:<br> “Be witness thou! immortal lord of all!<br> Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:<br> By none but Dolon shall this prize be borne,<br> And him

            “O friend! I hear some step of hostile feet,<br> Moving this way, or hastening to the fleet;<br> Some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;<br> Or nightly pillager that strips the slain.<br> Yet let him pass, and win a little space;<br> Then
            rush behind him, and prevent his pace.<br> But if too swift of foot he flies before,<br> Confine his course along the fleet and shore,<br> Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,<br> And intercept his hoped return to Troy.”
        </p>

            With that they stepp’d aside, and stoop’d their head,<br> (As Dolon pass’d,) behind a heap of dead:<br> Along the path the spy unwary flew;<br> Soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.<br> So distant they, and such the space between,<br>            As when two teams of mules divide the green,<br> (To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)<br> When now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.<br> Now Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass’d;<br> Hector (he thought) had sent, and
            check’d his haste,<br> Till scarce at distance of a javelin’s throw,<br> No voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.<br> As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;<br> Or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;<br> Now lost, now seen,
            they intercept his way,<br> And from the herd still turn the flying prey:<br> So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;<br> So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.<br> Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,<br> And mingles
            with the guards that watch the walls;<br> When brave Tydides stopp’d; a gen’rous thought<br> (Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,<br> Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance,<br> And snatch the glory from his lifted lance.<br> Then
            thus aloud: “Whoe’er thou art, remain;<br> This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain.”<br> He said, and high in air the weapon cast,<br> Which wilful err’d, and o’er his shoulder pass’d;<br> Then fix’d in earth.

        <p class="verse">
            “O spare my youth, and for the breath I owe,<br> Large gifts of price my father shall bestow:<br> Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,<br> And steel well-temper’d and refulgent gold.”

        <p class="verse">
            To whom Ulysses made this wise reply:<br> “Whoe’er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.<br> What moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight,<br> To roam the silent fields in dead of night?<br> Cam’st thou the secrets of our camp to find,<br>            By Hector prompted, or thy daring mind?<br> Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,<br> Through heaps of carnage, to despoil the dead?”

            Then thus pale Dolon, with a fearful look:<br> (Still, as he spoke, his limbs with horror shook:)<br> “Hither I came, by Hector’s words deceived;<br> Much did he promise, rashly I believed:<br> No less a bribe than great Achilles’ car,<br>            And those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,<br> Urged me, unwilling, this attempt to make;<br> To learn what counsels, what resolves you take:<br> If now subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,<br> And, tired with toils, neglect the
            watch of night.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Bold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,<br> (Ulysses, with a scornful smile, replies,)<br> Far other rulers those proud steeds demand,<br> And scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand;<br> Even great Achilles scarce their rage can tame,<br>            Achilles sprung from an immortal dame.<br> But say, be faithful, and the truth recite!<br> Where lies encamp’d the Trojan chief to-night?<br> Where stand his coursers? in what quarter sleep<br> Their other princes? tell what watch they keep:<br>            Say, since this conquest, what their counsels are;<br> Or here to combat, from their city far,<br> Or back to Ilion’s walls transfer the war?”

            Ulysses thus, and thus Eumedes’ son:<br> “What Dolon knows, his faithful tongue shall own.<br> Hector, the peers assembling in his tent,<br> A council holds at Ilus’ monument.<br> No certain guards the nightly watch partake;<br> Where’er yon
            fires ascend, the Trojans wake:<br> Anxious for Troy, the guard the natives keep;<br> Safe in their cares, the auxiliar forces sleep,<br> Whose wives and infants, from the danger far,<br> Discharge their souls of half the fears of war.”

        <p class="verse">
            To this Tydides, with a gloomy frown:<br> “Think not to live, though all the truth be shown:<br> Shall we dismiss thee, in some future strife<br> To risk more bravely thy now forfeit life?<br> Or that again our camps thou may’st explore?<br>            No—once a traitor, thou betray’st no more.”

            Sternly he spoke, and as the wretch prepared<br> With humble blandishment to stroke his beard,<br> Like lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew,<br> Divides the neck, and cuts the nerves in two;<br> One instant snatch’d his trembling soul
            to hell,<br> The head, yet speaking, mutter’d as it fell.<br> The furry helmet from his brow they tear,<br> The wolf’s grey hide, the unbended bow and spear;<br> These great Ulysses lifting to the skies,<br> To favouring Pallas dedicates the

            “Great queen of arms, receive this hostile spoil,<br> And let the Thracian steeds reward our toil;<br> Thee, first of all the heavenly host, we praise;<br> O speed our labours, and direct our ways!”<br> This said, the spoils, with dropping
            gore defaced,<br> High on a spreading tamarisk he placed;<br> Then heap’d with reeds and gathered boughs the plain,<br> To guide their footsteps to the place again.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Through the still night they cross the devious fields,<br> Slippery with blood, o’er arms and heaps of shields,<br> Arriving where the Thracian squadrons lay,<br> And eased in sleep the labours of the day.<br> Ranged in three lines they view
            the prostrate band:<br> The horses yoked beside each warrior stand.<br> Their arms in order on the ground reclined,<br> Through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined:<br> Amidst lay Rhesus, stretch’d in sleep profound,<br> And the white

        </p>

        <p class="center">
            THE THIRD BATTLE, AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            Agamemnon, having armed himself, leads the Grecians to battle; Hector prepares the Trojans to receive them, while Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva give the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is commanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for
            that purpose) to decline the engagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field. He then makes a great slaughter of the enemy. Ulysses and Diomed put a stop to him for a time but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is obliged
            to desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans, wounded, and in the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him. Hector comes against Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes, and rallies the Greeks. In the meantime Machaon,
            in the other wing of the army, is pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in Nestor’s chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action from his ship) sent Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that manner;
            Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the accidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which he remembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to fight for his countrymen, or at least to permit
            him to do it, clad in Achilles’ armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets Eurypylus also wounded, and assists him in that distress.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book opens with the eight-and-twentieth day of the poem, and the
            same day, with its various actions and adventures is extended through the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in the field near the monument of Ilus.

            The saffron morn, with early blushes spread,<a href="#fn219" name="fnref219"><sup>[219]</sup></a><br> Now rose refulgent from Tithonus’ bed;<br> With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,<br> And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:<br>            When baleful Eris, sent by Jove’s command,<br> The torch of discord blazing in her hand,<br> Through the red skies her bloody sign extends,<br> And, wrapt in tempests, o’er the fleet descends.<br> High on Ulysses’ bark her horrid stand<br>            She took, and thunder’d through the seas and land.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Even Ajax and Achilles heard the sound,<br> Whose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,<br> Thence the black fury through the Grecian throng<br> With horror sounds the loud Orthian song:<br> The navy shakes, and at the dire alarms<br> Each
            bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.<br> No more they sigh, inglorious to return,<br> But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.

        <p class="verse">
            The king of men his hardy host inspires<br> With loud command, with great example fires!<br> Himself first rose, himself before the rest<br> His mighty limbs in radiant armour dress’d,<br> And first he cased his manly legs around<br> In shining
            greaves with silver buckles bound;<br> The beaming cuirass next adorn’d his breast,<br> The same which once king Cinyras possess’d:<br> (The fame of Greece and her assembled host<br> Had reach’d that monarch on the Cyprian coast;<br> ’Twas
            then, the friendship of the chief to gain,<br> This glorious gift he sent, nor sent in vain:)<br> Ten rows of azure steel the work infold,<br> Twice ten of tin, and twelve of ductile gold;<br> Three glittering dragons to the gorget rise,<br>            Whose imitated scales against the skies<br> Reflected various light, and arching bow’d,<br> Like colour’d rainbows o’er a showery cloud<br> (Jove’s wondrous bow, of three celestial dies,<br> Placed as a sign to man amidst the skies).<br> A
            radiant baldric, o’er his shoulder tied,<br> Sustain’d the sword that glitter’d at his side:<br> Gold was the hilt, a silver sheath encased<br> The shining blade, and golden hangers graced.<br> His buckler’s mighty orb was next display’d,<br>            That round the warrior cast a dreadful shade;<br> Ten zones of brass its ample brim surround,<br> And twice ten bosses the bright convex crown’d:<br> Tremendous Gorgon frown’d upon its field,<br> And circling terrors fill’d the expressive
            shield:
            <br> Within its concave hung a silver thong,<br> On which a mimic serpent creeps along,<br> His azure length in easy waves extends,<br> Till in three heads the embroider’d monster ends.<br> Last o’er his brows his fourfold helm he placed,<br>            With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;<br> And in his hands two steely javelins wields,<br> That blaze to heaven, and lighten all the fields.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            That instant Juno, and the martial maid,<br> In happy thunders promised Greece their aid;<br> High o’er the chief they clash’d their arms in air,<br> And, leaning from the clouds, expect the war.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Close to the limits of the trench and mound,<br> The fiery coursers to their chariots bound<br> The squires restrain’d: the foot, with those who wield<br> The lighter arms, rush forward to the field.<br> To second these, in close array combined,<br>            The squadrons spread their sable wings behind.<br> Now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun,<br> As with the light the warriors’ toils begun.<br> Even Jove, whose thunder spoke his wrath, distill’d<br> Red drops of blood o’er all the fatal

            Near Ilus’ tomb, in order ranged around,<br> The Trojan lines possess’d the rising ground:<br> There wise Polydamas and Hector stood;<br> Æneas, honour’d as a guardian god;<br> Bold Polybus, Agenor the divine;<br> The brother-warriors of Antenor’s
            line:
            <br> With youthful Acamas, whose beauteous face<br> And fair proportion match’d the ethereal race.<br> Great Hector, cover’d with his spacious shield,<br> Plies all the troops, and orders all the field.<br> As the red star now shows his sanguine

            <br> Through the dark clouds, and now in night retires,<br> Thus through the ranks appear’d the godlike man,<br> Plunged in the rear, or blazing in the van;<br> While streamy sparkles, restless as he flies,<br> Flash from his arms, as lightning
            from the skies.<br> As sweating reapers in some wealthy field,<br> Ranged in two bands, their crooked weapons wield,<br> Bear down the furrows, till their labours meet;<br> Thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet:<br> So Greece and Troy
            the field of war divide,<br> And falling ranks are strow’d on every side.<br> None stoop’d a thought to base inglorious flight;<a href="#fn221" name="fnref221"><sup>[221]</sup></a><br> But horse to horse, and man to man they fight,<br> Not

            train,
            <br> Swells the red horrors of this direful plain:<br> The gods in peace their golden mansions fill,<br> Ranged in bright order on the Olympian hill:<br> But general murmurs told their griefs above,<br> And each accused the partial will of
            Jove.<br> Meanwhile apart, superior, and alone,<br> The eternal Monarch, on his awful throne,<br> Wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate;<br> And fix’d, fulfill’d the just decrees of fate.<br> On earth he turn’d his all-considering eyes,
            <br> And mark’d the spot where Ilion’s towers arise;<br> The sea with ships, the fields with armies spread,<br> The victor’s rage, the dying, and the dead.

        <p class="verse">
            Thus while the morning-beams, increasing bright,<br> O’er heaven’s pure azure spread the glowing light,<br> Commutual death the fate of war confounds,<br> Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.<br> But now (what time in some sequester’d
            vale

            armour vain:<br> Now soil’d with dust, and naked to the sky,<br> Their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie.

        <p class="verse">
            Two sons of Priam next to battle move,<br> The product, one of marriage, one of love:<a href="#fn222" name="fnref222"><sup>[222]</sup></a><br> In the same car the brother-warriors ride;<br> This took the charge to combat, that to guide:<br>            Far other task, than when they wont to keep,<br> On Ida’s tops, their father’s fleecy sheep.<br> These on the mountains once Achilles found,<br> And captive led, with pliant osiers bound;<br> Then to their sire for ample sums restored;<br>            But now to perish by Atrides’ sword:<br> Pierced in the breast the base-born Isus bleeds:<br> Cleft through the head his brother’s fate succeeds,<br> Swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls,<br> And, stript, their features to his mind recalls.<br>            The Trojans see the youths untimely die,<br> But helpless tremble for themselves, and fly.<br> So when a lion ranging o’er the lawns,<br> Finds, on some grassy lair, the couching fawns,<br> Their bones he cracks, their reeking vitals draws,<br>            And grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws;<br> The frighted hind beholds, and dares not stay,<br> But swift through rustling thickets bursts her way;<br> All drown’d in sweat, the panting mother flies,
            <br> And the big tears roll trickling from her eyes.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Amidst the tumult of the routed train,<br> The sons of false Antimachus were slain;<br> He who for bribes his faithless counsels sold,<br> And voted Helen’s stay for Paris’ gold.<br> Atrides mark’d, as these their safety sought,<br> And slew
            the children for the father’s fault;<br> Their headstrong horse unable to restrain,<br> They shook with fear, and dropp’d the silken rein;<br> Then in the chariot on their knees they fall,<br> And thus with lifted hands for mercy call:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O spare our youth, and for the life we owe,<br> Antimachus shall copious gifts bestow:<br> Soon as he hears, that, not in battle slain,<br> The Grecian ships his captive sons detain,<br> Large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told,<br> And
            steel well-tempered, and persuasive gold.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            These words, attended with the flood of tears,<br> The youths address’d to unrelenting ears:<br> The vengeful monarch gave this stern reply:<br> “If from Antimachus ye spring, ye die;<br> The daring wretch who once in council stood<br> To
            shed Ulysses’ and my brother’s blood,<br> For proffer’d peace! and sues his seed for grace?<br> No, die, and pay the forfeit of your race.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            This said, Pisander from the car he cast,<br> And pierced his breast: supine he breathed his last.<br> His brother leap’d to earth; but, as he lay,<br> The trenchant falchion lopp’d his hands away;<br> His sever’d head was toss’d among the
            throng,
            <br> And, rolling, drew a bloody train along.<br> Then, where the thickest fought, the victor flew;<br> The king’s example all his Greeks pursue.<br> Now by the foot the flying foot were slain,<br> Horse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.<br>            From the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,<br> Shade the black host, and intercept the skies.<br> The brass-hoof’d steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,<br> And the thick thunder beats the labouring ground,<br> Still slaughtering on, the
            king of men proceeds;<br> The distanced army wonders at his deeds,<br> As when the winds with raging flames conspire,<br> And o’er the forests roll the flood of fire,<br> In blazing heaps the grove’s old honours fall,<br> And one refulgent
            ruin levels all:<br> Before Atrides’ rage so sinks the foe,<br> Whole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.<br> The steeds fly trembling from his waving sword,<br> And many a car, now lighted of its lord,<br> Wide o’er the field with
            guideless fury rolls,<br> Breaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls;<br> While his keen falchion drinks the warriors’ lives;<br> More grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!

            foe;
            <br> But, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,<br> And add one spectre to the realms below!”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,<br> Trembling gave way, and turn’d his back to flight;<br> Between his shoulders pierced the following dart,<br> And held its passage through the panting heart:<br> Wide in his breast appear’d
            the grisly wound;<br> He falls; his armour rings against the ground.<br> Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:<br> “Famed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;<br> There ends thy narrow span assign’d by fate,<br> Heaven owes Ulysses yet

            Thus having spoke, the driver’s lash resounds;<br> Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;<br> Stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,<br> O’er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.<br> The horses’ hoofs are bathed
            in heroes’ gore,<br> And, dashing, purple all the car before;<br> The groaning axle sable drops distils,<br> And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.<br> Here Hector, plunging through the thickest fight,<br> Broke the dark phalanx, and
            let in the light:<br> (By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,<br> The ranks he scatter’d and the troops o’erthrown:)<br> Ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,<br> And fears that arm whose force he felt so late.<br> But partial

            THE BATTLE AT THE GRECIAN WALL.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            The Greeks having retired into their intrenchments, Hector attempts to force them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas advises to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot. The Trojans follow his counsel; and having divided
            their army into five bodies of foot, begin the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons, which appeared on the left hand of the Trojans, Polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again. This Hector opposes, and continues
            the attack; in which, after many actions, Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall. Hector also, casting a stone of vast size, forces open one of the gates, and enters at the head of his troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians even
            to their ships.

        <p class="verse">
            While thus the hero’s pious cares attend<br> The cure and safety of his wounded friend,<br> Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage,<br> And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.<br> Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;<br>            With gods averse the ill-fated works arose;<br> Their powers neglected, and no victim slain,<br> The walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.

            <br> And half the skies descend in sluicy showers.<br> The god of ocean, marching stern before,<br> With his huge trident wounds the trembling shore,<br> Vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves,<br> And whelms the smoky ruin in
            the waves.<br> Now smooth’d with sand, and levell’d by the flood,<br> No fragment tells where once the wonder stood;<br> In their old bounds the rivers roll again,<br> Shine ’twixt the hills, or wander o’er the plain.

            But this the gods in later times perform;<br> As yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm;<br> The strokes yet echoed of contending powers;<br> War thunder’d at the gates, and blood distain’d the towers.<br> Smote by the arm of Jove with
            dire dismay,<br> Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:<br> Hector’s approach in every wind they hear,<br> And Hector’s fury every moment fear.<br> He, like a whirlwind, toss’d the scattering throng,<br> Mingled the troops, and drove
            the field along.<br> So ’midst the dogs and hunters’ daring bands,<br> Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;<br> Arm’d foes around a dreadful circle form,<br> And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:<br> His powers untamed, their bold
            assault defy,<br> And where he turns the rout disperse or die:<br> He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,<br> And if he falls, his courage makes him fall.<br> With equal rage encompass’d Hector glows;<br> Exhorts his armies, and
            the trenches shows.<br> The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,<br> And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;<br> Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,<br> And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.<br> Eager they view’d
            the prospect dark and deep,<br> Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;<br> The bottom bare, (a formidable show!)<br> And bristled thick with sharpen’d stakes below.<br> The foot alone this strong defence could force,<br> And try the
            pass impervious to the horse.<br> This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,<br> Restrain’d great Hector, and this counsel gave:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!<br> And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!<br> What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,<br> The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?<br> No pass through those, without a thousand
            wounds,
            <br> No space for combat in yon narrow bounds.<br> Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,<br> On certain dangers we too rashly run:<br> If ’tis his will our haughty foes to tame,<br> Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!<br> Here,
            far from Argos, let their heroes fall,<br> And one great day destroy and bury all!<br> But should they turn, and here oppress our train,<br> What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?<br> Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,<br>            In one promiscuous carnage crush’d and bruised,<br> All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,<br> Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.<br> Hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed;<br> Back from the trenches let your steeds be led;<br>            Then all alighting, wedged in firm array,<br> Proceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.<br> So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power,<br> And this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour.”

        <p class="verse">
            This counsel pleased: the godlike Hector sprung<br> Swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.<br> The chief’s example follow’d by his train,<br> Each quits his car, and issues on the plain,<br> By orders strict the charioteers enjoin’d<br>            Compel the coursers to their ranks behind.<br> The forces part in five distinguish’d bands,<br> And all obey their several chiefs’ commands.<br> The best and bravest in the first conspire,<br> Pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with
            fire:
            <br> Great Hector glorious in the van of these,<br> Polydamas, and brave Cebriones.<br> Before the next the graceful Paris shines,<br> And bold Alcathous, and Agenor joins.<br> The sons of Priam with the third appear,<br> Deiphobus, and Helenas
            the seer;<br> In arms with these the mighty Asius stood,<br> Who drew from Hyrtacus his noble blood,<br> And whom Arisba’s yellow coursers bore,<br> The coursers fed on Selle’s winding shore.<br> Antenor’s sons the fourth battalion guide,
            <br> And great Æneas, born on fountful Ide.<br> Divine Sarpedon the last band obey’d,<br> Whom Glaucus and Asteropaeus aid.<br> Next him, the bravest, at their army’s head,<br> But he more brave than all the hosts he led.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Now with compacted shields in close array,<br> The moving legions speed their headlong way:<br> Already in their hopes they fire the fleet,<br> And see the Grecians gasping at their feet.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            While every Trojan thus, and every aid,<br> The advice of wise Polydamas obey’d,<br> Asius alone, confiding in his car,<br> His vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.<br> Unhappy hero! and advised in vain;<br> Those wheels returning ne’er
            shall mark the plain;<br> No more those coursers with triumphant joy<br> Restore their master to the gates of Troy!<br> Black death attends behind the Grecian wall,<br> And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!<br> Fierce to the left he drives,
            where from the plain<br> The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;<br> Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass’d,<br> The gates half-open’d to receive the last.<br> Thither, exulting in his force, he flies:<br> His following
            host with clamours rend the skies:<br> To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main,<br> Such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,<br> Who from the Lapiths’ warlike race descend;<br> This Polypoetes, great Perithous’ heir,<br> And that Leonteus, like the god of war.<br> As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;<br> Their
            roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:<br> Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown’d,<br> Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground;<br> High on the hills appears their stately form,<br> And their deep roots for ever brave the
            storm.
            <br> So graceful these, and so the shock they stand<br> Of raging Asius, and his furious band.<br> Orestes, Acamas, in front appear,<br> And Œnomaus and Thoon close the rear:<br> In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,<br> In vain
            around them beat their hollow shields;<br> The fearless brothers on the Grecians call,<br> To guard their navies, and defend the wall.<br> Even when they saw Troy’s sable troops impend,<br> And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend,<br>            Forth from the portals rush’d the intrepid pair,<br> Opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.<br> So two wild boars spring furious from their den,<br> Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;<br> On every side the crackling
            trees they tear,<br> And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;<br> They gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,<br> Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.<br> Around their heads the whistling javelins sung,<br> With
            sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;<br> Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers<br> Maintain’d the walls, and mann’d the lofty towers:<br> To save their fleet their last efforts they try,<br> And stones and darts in mingled
            tempests fly.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings<br> The dreary winter on his frozen wings;<br> Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow<br> Descend, and whiten all the fields below:<br> So fast the darts on either army pour,<br> So down
            the rampires rolls the rocky shower:<br> Heavy, and thick, resound the batter’d shields,<br> And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            With shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,<br> The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:<br> “In powers immortal who shall now believe?<br> Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive?<br> What man could doubt but Troy’s victorious power<br>            Should humble Greece, and this her fatal hour?<br> But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,<br> To guard the entrance of their common hive,<br> Darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings<br> They strike the assailants, and infix
            their stings;<br> A race determined, that to death contend:<br> So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.<br> Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates,<br> Repel an army, and defraud the fates?”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            These empty accents mingled with the wind,<br> Nor moved great Jove’s unalterable mind;<br> To godlike Hector and his matchless might<br> Was owed the glory of the destined fight.<br> Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,<br>            And all the gates sustain’d an equal tide;<br> Through the long walls the stony showers were heard,<br> The blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear’d.<br> The spirit of a god my breast inspire,<br> To raise each act to life, and sing with
            fire!
            <br> While Greece unconquer’d kept alive the war,<br> Secure of death, confiding in despair;<br> And all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,<br> With unassisting arms deplored the day.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain<br> The dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.<br> First Damasus, by Polypoetes’ steel,<br> Pierced through his helmet’s brazen visor, fell;<br> The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!<br>            The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!<br> Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:<br> Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death;<br> First through the belt Hippomachus he gored,<br> Then sudden waved his unresisted sword:<br> Antiphates,
            as through the ranks he broke,<br> The falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:<br> Iamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;<br> And round him rose a monument of dead.<br> Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,<br> Bold Hector and Polydamas,
            pursue;
            <br> Fierce with impatience on the works to fall,<br> And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.<br> These on the farther bank now stood and gazed,<br> By Heaven alarm’d, by prodigies amazed:<br> A signal omen stopp’d the passing host,
            <br> Their martial fury in their wonder lost.<br> Jove’s bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;<br> A bleeding serpent of enormous size,<br> His talons truss’d; alive, and curling round,<br> He stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:<br>            Mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,<br> In airy circles wings his painful way,<br> Floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:<br> Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.<br> They, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll’d,<br>            And Jove’s portent with beating hearts behold.<br> Then first Polydamas the silence broke,<br> Long weigh’d the signal, and to Hector spoke:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear,<br> For words well meant, and sentiments sincere?<br> True to those counsels which I judge the best,<br> I tell the faithful dictates of my breast.<br> To speak his thoughts is every freeman’s right,<br>            In peace, in war, in council, and in fight;<br> And all I move, deferring to thy sway,<br> But tends to raise that power which I obey.<br> Then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!<br> Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;<br> For
            sure, to warn us, Jove his omen sent,<br> And thus my mind explains its clear event:<br> The victor eagle, whose sinister flight<br> Retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,<br> Dismiss’d his conquest in the middle skies,<br> Allow’d
            to seize, but not possess the prize;<br> Thus, though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet,<br> Though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,<br> Toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed;<br> More woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.<br>            So bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise;<br> For thus a skilful seer would read the skies.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To him then Hector with disdain return’d:<br> (Fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn’d:)<br> “Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?<br> Thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong:<br> Or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,<br>            Sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.<br> What coward counsels would thy madness move<br> Against the word, the will reveal’d of Jove?<br> The leading sign, the irrevocable nod,<br> And happy thunders of the favouring god,<br> These
            shall I slight, and guide my wavering mind<br> By wandering birds that flit with every wind?<br> Ye vagrants of the sky! your wings extend,<br> Or where the suns arise, or where descend;<br> To right, to left, unheeded take your way,<br> While
            I the dictates of high heaven obey.<br> Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,<br> And asks no omen but his country’s cause.<br> But why should’st thou suspect the war’s success?<br> None fears it more, as none promotes it less:<br>            Though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,<br> Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.<br> Troy and her sons may find a general grave,<br> But thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.<br> Yet should the fears that wary mind suggests<br>            Spread their cold poison through our soldiers’ breasts,<br> My javelin can revenge so base a part,<br> And free the soul that quivers in thy heart.”

            Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers;<br> And now the stones descend in heavier showers.<br> As when high Jove his sharp artillery forms,<br> And opes his cloudy magazine of storms;<br> In winter’s bleak uncomfortable reign,<br> A snowy
            inundation hides the plain;<br> He stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep;<br> Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep;<br> And first the mountain-tops are cover’d o’er,<br> Then the green fields, and then the sandy shore;<br>            Bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,<br> And one bright waste hides all the works of men:<br> The circling seas, alone absorbing all,<br> Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:<br> So from each side increased the stony rain,<br>            And the white ruin rises o’er the plain.

            gold:
            <br> And while two pointed javelins arm his hands,<br> Majestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.

        <p class="verse">
            High on the walls appear’d the Lycian powers,<br> Like some black tempest gathering round the towers:<br> The Greeks, oppress’d, their utmost force unite,<br> Prepared to labour in the unequal fight:<br> The war renews, mix’d shouts and groans

            THE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED, IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS: THE ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            Neptune, concerned for the loss of the Grecians, upon seeing the fortification forced by Hector, (who had entered the gate near the station of the Ajaces,) assumes the shape of Calchas, and inspires those heroes to oppose him: then, in the form of one
            of the generals, encourages the other Greeks who had retired to their vessels. The Ajaces form their troops in a close phalanx, and put a stop to Hector and the Trojans. Several deeds of valour are performed; Meriones, losing his spear in
            the encounter, repairs to seek another at the tent of Idomeneus: this occasions a conversation between those two warriors, who return together to the battle. Idomeneus signalizes his courage above the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and
            Alcathous: Deiphobus and Æneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus retires. Menelaus wounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The Trojans are repulsed on the left wing; Hector still keeps his ground against the Ajaces, till, being galled
            by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas advises to call a council of war: Hector approves of his advice, but goes first to rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax again, and renews the attack.<br>            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the Grecian wall and the sea-shore.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            When now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast<br> Had fix’d great Hector and his conquering host,<br> He left them to the fates, in bloody fray<br> To toil and struggle through the well-fought day.<br> Then turn’d to Thracia from the field
            of fight<br> Those eyes that shed insufferable light,<br> To where the Mysians prove their martial force,<br> And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse;<br> And where the far-famed Hippomolgian strays,<br> Renown’d for justice and for length
            of days;<a href="#fn229" name="fnref229"><sup>[229]</sup></a><br> Thrice happy race! that, innocent of blood,<br> From milk, innoxious, seek their simple food:<br> Jove sees delighted; and avoids the scene<br> Of guilty Troy, of arms, and
            dying men:<br> No aid, he deems, to either host is given,<br> While his high law suspends the powers of Heaven.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Meantime the monarch of the watery main<br> Observed the Thunderer, nor observed in vain.<br> In Samothracia, on a mountain’s brow,<br> Whose waving woods o’erhung the deeps below,<br> He sat; and round him cast his azure eyes<br> Where Ida’s
            misty tops confusedly rise;<br> Below, fair Ilion’s glittering spires were seen;<br> The crowded ships and sable seas between.<br> There, from the crystal chambers of the main<br> Emerged, he sat, and mourn’d his Argives slain.<br> At Jove
            incensed, with grief and fury stung,<br> Prone down the rocky steep he rush’d along;<br> Fierce as he pass’d, the lofty mountains nod,<br> The forest shakes; earth trembled as he trod,<br> And felt the footsteps of the immortal god.<br> From
            realm to realm three ample strides he took,<br> And, at the fourth, the distant Ægae shook.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Far in the bay his shining palace stands,<br> Eternal frame! not raised by mortal hands:<br> This having reach’d, his brass-hoof’d steeds he reins,<br> Fleet as the winds, and deck’d with golden manes.<br> Refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold,<br>            Immortal arms of adamant and gold.<br> He mounts the car, the golden scourge applies,<br> He sits superior, and the chariot flies:<br> His whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep;<br> The enormous monsters rolling o’er the deep<br> Gambol
            around him on the watery way,<br> And heavy whales in awkward measures play;<br> The sea subsiding spreads a level plain,<br> Exults, and owns the monarch of the main;<br> The parting waves before his coursers fly;<br> The wondering waters
            leave his axle dry.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Deep in the liquid regions lies a cave,<br> Between where Tenedos the surges lave,<br> And rocky Imbrus breaks the rolling wave:<br> There the great ruler of the azure round<br> Stopp’d his swift chariot, and his steeds unbound,<br> Fed with
            ambrosial herbage from his hand,<br> And link’d their fetlocks with a golden band,<br> Infrangible, immortal: there they stay:<br> The father of the floods pursues his way:<br> Where, like a tempest, darkening heaven around,<br> Or fiery deluge
            that devours the ground,<br> The impatient Trojans, in a gloomy throng,<br> Embattled roll’d, as Hector rush’d along:<br> To the loud tumult and the barbarous cry<br> The heavens re-echo, and the shores reply:<br> They vow destruction to the
            Grecian name,<br> And in their hopes the fleets already flame.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            But Neptune, rising from the seas profound,<br> The god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground,<br> Now wears a mortal form; like Calchas seen,<br> Such his loud voice, and such his manly mien;<br> His shouts incessant every Greek inspire,<br>            But most the Ajaces, adding fire to fire.

            JUNO DECEIVES JUPITER BY THE GIRDLE OF VENUS.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            Nestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is alarmed with the increasing clamour of war, and hastens to Agamemnon; on his way he meets that prince with Diomed and Ulysses, whom he informs of the extremity of the danger. Agamemnon proposes to make their
            escape by night, which Ulysses withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that, wounded as they were, they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence, which advice is pursued. Juno, seeing the partiality of Jupiter to the
            Trojans, forms a design to over-reach him: she sets off her charms with the utmost care, and (the more surely to enchant him) obtains the magic girdle of Venus. She then applies herself to the god of sleep, and, with some difficulty, persuades
            him to seal the eyes of Jupiter: this done, she goes to mount Ida, where the god, at first sight, is ravished with her beauty, sinks in her embraces, and is laid asleep. Neptune takes advantage of his slumber, and succours the Greeks: Hector
            is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax, and carried off from the battle: several actions succeed, till the Trojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way: the lesser Ajax signalizes himself in a particular manner.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            But not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,<br> Could charm the cares of Nestor’s watchful soul;<br> His startled ears the increasing cries attend;<br> Then thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “What new alarm, divine Machaon, say,<br> What mix’d events attend this mighty day?<br> Hark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet,<br> And now come full, and thicken to the fleet!<br> Here with the cordial draught dispel thy care,<br>            Let Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare,<br> Refresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore;<br> While I the adventures of the day explore.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He said: and, seizing Thrasymedes’ shield,<br> (His valiant offspring,) hasten’d to the field;<br> (That day the son his father’s buckler bore;)<br> Then snatch’d a lance, and issued from the door.<br> Soon as the prospect open’d to his view,<br>            His wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew;<br> Dire disarray! the tumult of the fight,<br> The wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight.<br> As when old ocean’s silent surface sleeps,<br> The waves just heaving on the purple deeps:<br> While
            yet the expected tempest hangs on high,<br> Weighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky,<br> The mass of waters will no wind obey;<br> Jove sends one gust, and bids them roll away.<br> While wavering counsels thus his mind engage,<br> Fluctuates
            in doubtful thought the Pylian sage,<br> To join the host, or to the general haste;<br> Debating long, he fixes on the last:<br> Yet, as he moves, the sight his bosom warms,<br> The field rings dreadful with the clang of arms,<br> The gleaming
            falchions flash, the javelins fly;<br> Blows echo blows, and all or kill or die.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Him, in his march, the wounded princes meet,<br> By tardy steps ascending from the fleet:<br> The king of men, Ulysses the divine,<br> And who to Tydeus owes his noble line<a href="#fn232" name="fnref232"><sup>[232]</sup></a><br> (Their ships
            at distance from the battle stand,<br> In lines advanced along the shelving strand:<br> Whose bay, the fleet unable to contain<br> At length; beside the margin of the main,<br> Rank above rank, the crowded ships they moor:<br> Who landed first,
            lay highest on the shore.)<br> Supported on the spears, they took their way,<br> Unfit to fight, but anxious for the day.<br> Nestor’s approach alarm’d each Grecian breast,<br> Whom thus the general of the host address’d:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O grace and glory of the Achaian name;<br> What drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame?<br> Shall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill’d,<br> Our fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill’d?<br> Such was his threat, ah! now too soon made
            good,
            <br> On many a Grecian bosom writ in blood.<br> Is every heart inflamed with equal rage<br> Against your king, nor will one chief engage?<br> And have I lived to see with mournful eyes<br> In every Greek a new Achilles rise?”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Gerenian Nestor then: “So fate has will’d;<br> And all-confirming time has fate fulfill’d.<br> Not he that thunders from the aerial bower,<br> Not Jove himself, upon the past has power.<br> The wall, our late inviolable bound,<br> And best
            defence, lies smoking on the ground:<br> Even to the ships their conquering arms extend,<br> And groans of slaughter’d Greeks to heaven ascend.<br> On speedy measures then employ your thought<br> In such distress! if counsel profit aught:<br>            Arms cannot much: though Mars our souls incite,<br> These gaping wounds withhold us from the fight.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To him the monarch: “That our army bends,<br> That Troy triumphant our high fleet ascends,<br> And that the rampart, late our surest trust<br> And best defence, lies smoking in the dust;<br> All this from Jove’s afflictive hand we bear,<br>            Who, far from Argos, wills our ruin here.<br> Past are the days when happier Greece was blest,<br> And all his favour, all his aid confess’d;<br> Now heaven averse, our hands from battle ties,<br> And lifts the Trojan glory to the skies.<br>            Cease we at length to waste our blood in vain,<br> And launch what ships lie nearest to the main;<br> Leave these at anchor, till the coming night:<br> Then, if impetuous Troy forbear the fight,<br> Bring all to sea, and hoist each sail for
            flight.
            <br> Better from evils, well foreseen, to run,<br> Than perish in the danger we may shun.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus he. The sage Ulysses thus replies,<br> While anger flash’d from his disdainful eyes:<br> “What shameful words (unkingly as thou art)<br> Fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart?<br> Oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers,<br>            And thou the shame of any host but ours!<br> A host, by Jove endued with martial might,<br> And taught to conquer, or to fall in fight:<br> Adventurous combats and bold wars to wage,<br> Employ’d our youth, and yet employs our age.<br> And
            wilt thou thus desert the Trojan plain?<br> And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?<br> In such base sentence if thou couch thy fear,<br> Speak it in whispers, lest a Greek should hear.<br> Lives there a man so dead to fame, who
            dares
            <br> To think such meanness, or the thought declares?<br> And comes it even from him whose sovereign sway<br> The banded legions of all Greece obey?<br> Is this a general’s voice that calls to flight,<br> While war hangs doubtful, while his
            soldiers fight?<br> What more could Troy? What yet their fate denies<br> Thou givest the foe: all Greece becomes their prize.<br> No more the troops (our hoisted sails in view,<br> Themselves abandon’d) shall the fight pursue;<br> But thy
            ships flying, with despair shall see;<br> And owe destruction to a prince like thee.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Thy just reproofs (Atrides calm replies)<br> Like arrows pierce me, for thy words are wise.<br> Unwilling as I am to lose the host,<br> I force not Greece to quit this hateful coast;<br> Glad I submit, whoe’er, or young, or old,<br> Aught,
            more conducive to our weal, unfold.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Tydides cut him short, and thus began:<br> “Such counsel if you seek, behold the man<br> Who boldly gives it, and what he shall say,<br> Young though he be, disdain not to obey:<br> A youth, who from the mighty Tydeus springs,<br> May speak
            to councils and assembled kings.<br> Hear then in me the great OEnides’ son,<br> Whose honoured dust (his race of glory run)<br> Lies whelm’d in ruins of the Theban wall;<br> Brave in his life, and glorious in his fall.<br> With three bold
            sons was generous Prothous bless’d,<br> Who Pleuron’s walls and Calydon possess’d;<br> Melas and Agrius, but (who far surpass’d<br> The rest in courage) OEneus was the last.<br> From him, my sire. From Calydon expell’d,<br> He pass’d to Argos,
            and in exile dwell’d;<br> The monarch’s daughter there (so Jove ordain’d)<br> He won, and flourish’d where Adrastus reign’d;<br> There, rich in fortune’s gifts, his acres till’d,<br> Beheld his vines their liquid harvest yield,<br> And numerous
            flocks that whiten’d all the field.<br> Such Tydeus was, the foremost once in fame!<br> Nor lives in Greece a stranger to his name.<br> Then, what for common good my thoughts inspire,<br> Attend, and in the son respect the sire.<br> Though
            sore of battle, though with wounds oppress’d,<br> Let each go forth, and animate the rest,<br> Advance the glory which he cannot share,<br> Though not partaker, witness of the war.<br> But lest new wounds on wounds o’erpower us quite,<br>            Beyond the missile javelin’s sounding flight,<br> Safe let us stand; and, from the tumult far,<br> Inspire the ranks, and rule the distant war.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He added not: the listening kings obey,<br> Slow moving on; Atrides leads the way.<br> The god of ocean (to inflame their rage)<br> Appears a warrior furrowed o’er with age;<br> Press’d in his own, the general’s hand he took,<br> And thus
            the venerable hero spoke:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Atrides! lo! with what disdainful eye<br> Achilles sees his country’s forces fly;<br> Blind, impious man! whose anger is his guide,<br> Who glories in unutterable pride.<br> So may he perish, so may Jove disclaim<br> The wretch relentless,
            and o’erwhelm with shame!<br> But Heaven forsakes not thee: o’er yonder sands<br> Soon shall thou view the scattered Trojan bands<br> Fly diverse; while proud kings, and chiefs renown’d,<br> Driven heaps on heaps, with clouds involved around<br>            Of rolling dust, their winged wheels employ<br> To hide their ignominious heads in Troy.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He spoke, then rush’d amid the warrior crew,<br> And sent his voice before him as he flew,<br> Loud, as the shout encountering armies yield<br> When twice ten thousand shake the labouring field;<br> Such was the voice, and such the thundering
            sound
            <br> Of him whose trident rends the solid ground.<br> Each Argive bosom beats to meet the fight,<br> And grisly war appears a pleasing sight.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Meantime Saturnia from Olympus’ brow,<br> High-throned in gold, beheld the fields below;<br> With joy the glorious conflict she survey’d,<br> Where her great brother gave the Grecians aid.<br> But placed aloft, on Ida’s shady height<br> She
            sees her Jove, and trembles at the sight.<br> Jove to deceive, what methods shall she try,<br> What arts, to blind his all-beholding eye?<br> At length she trusts her power; resolved to prove<br> The old, yet still successful, cheat of love;<br>            Against his wisdom to oppose her charms,<br> And lull the lord of thunders in her arms.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Swift to her bright apartment she repairs,<br> Sacred to dress and beauty’s pleasing cares:<br> With skill divine had Vulcan form’d the bower,<br> Safe from access of each intruding power.<br> Touch’d with her secret key, the doors unfold:<br>            Self-closed, behind her shut the valves of gold.<br> Here first she bathes; and round her body pours<br> Soft oils of fragrance, and ambrosial showers:<br> The winds, perfumed, the balmy gale convey<br> Through heaven, through earth, and all
            the aerial way:<br> Spirit divine! whose exhalation greets<br> The sense of gods with more than mortal sweets.<br> Thus while she breathed of heaven, with decent pride<br> Her artful hands the radiant tresses tied;<br> Part on her head in
            shining ringlets roll’d,<br> Part o’er her shoulders waved like melted gold.<br> Around her next a heavenly mantle flow’d,<br> That rich with Pallas’ labour’d colours glow’d:<br> Large clasps of gold the foldings gather’d round,<br> A golden
            zone her swelling bosom bound.<br> Far-beaming pendants tremble in her ear,<br> Each gem illumined with a triple star.<br> Then o’er her head she cast a veil more white<br> Than new-fallen snow, and dazzling as the light.<br> Last her fair
            feet celestial sandals grace.<br> Thus issuing radiant with majestic pace,<br> Forth from the dome the imperial goddess moves,<br> And calls the mother of the smiles and loves.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “How long (to Venus thus apart she cried)<br> Shall human strife celestial minds divide?<br> Ah yet, will Venus aid Saturnia’s joy,<br> And set aside the cause of Greece and Troy?”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Let heaven’s dread empress (Cytheraea said)<br> Speak her request, and deem her will obey’d.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Then grant me (said the queen) those conquering charms,<br> That power, which mortals and immortals warms,<br> That love, which melts mankind in fierce desires,<br> And burns the sons of heaven with sacred fires!
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “For lo! I haste to those remote abodes,<br> Where the great parents, (sacred source of gods!)<br> Ocean and Tethys their old empire keep,<br> On the last limits of the land and deep.<br> In their kind arms my tender years were past;<br> What
            time old Saturn, from Olympus cast,<br> Of upper heaven to Jove resign’d the reign,<br> Whelm’d under the huge mass of earth and main.<br> For strife, I hear, has made the union cease,<br> Which held so long that ancient pair in peace.<br>            What honour, and what love, shall I obtain,<br> If I compose those fatal feuds again;<br> Once more their minds in mutual ties engage,<br> And, what my youth has owed, repay their age!”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            She said. With awe divine, the queen of love<br> Obey’d the sister and the wife of Jove;<br> And from her fragrant breast the zone embraced,<a href="#fn233" name="fnref233"><sup>[233]</sup></a><br> With various skill and high embroidery graced.<br>            In this was every art, and every charm,<br> To win the wisest, and the coldest warm:<br> Fond love, the gentle vow, the gay desire,<br> The kind deceit, the still-reviving fire,<br> Persuasive speech, and the more persuasive sighs,<br> Silence
            that spoke, and eloquence of eyes.<br> This on her hand the Cyprian Goddess laid:<br> “Take this, and with it all thy wish;” she said.<br> With smiles she took the charm; and smiling press’d<br> The powerful cestus to her snowy breast.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then Venus to the courts of Jove withdrew;<br> Whilst from Olympus pleased Saturnia flew.<br> O’er high Pieria thence her course she bore,<br> O’er fair Emathia’s ever-pleasing shore,<br> O’er Hemus’ hills with snows eternal crown’d;<br> Nor
            once her flying foot approach’d the ground.<br> Then taking wing from Athos’ lofty steep,<br> She speeds to Lemnos o’er the rolling deep,<br> And seeks the cave of Death’s half-brother, Sleep.<a href="#fn234" name="fnref234"><sup>[234]</sup></a>

            has Vulcan form’d thy bower,<br> Sacred to love and to the genial hour;<br> If such thy will, to that recess retire,<br> In secret there indulge thy soft desire.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            She ceased; and, smiling with superior love,<br> Thus answer’d mild the cloud-compelling Jove:<br> “Nor god nor mortal shall our joys behold,<br> Shaded with clouds, and circumfused in gold;<br> Not even the sun, who darts through heaven his
            rays,
            <br> And whose broad eye the extended earth surveys.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Gazing he spoke, and, kindling at the view,<br> His eager arms around the goddess threw.<br> Glad Earth perceives, and from her bosom pours<br> Unbidden herbs and voluntary flowers:<br> Thick new-born violets a soft carpet spread,<br> And
            clustering lotos swell’d the rising bed,<br> And sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow,<a href="#fn237" name="fnref237"><sup>[237]</sup></a><br> And flamy crocus made the mountain glow<br> There golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair,<br> Steep’d
            in soft joys and circumfused with air;<br> Celestial dews, descending o’er the ground,<br> Perfume the mount, and breathe ambrosia round:<br> At length, with love and sleep’s soft power oppress’d,<br> The panting thunderer nods, and sinks
            to rest.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Now to the navy borne on silent wings,<br> To Neptune’s ear soft Sleep his message brings;<br> Beside him sudden, unperceived, he stood,<br> And thus with gentle words address’d the god:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Now, Neptune! now, the important hour employ,<br> To check a while the haughty hopes of Troy:<br> While Jove yet rests, while yet my vapours shed<br> The golden vision round his sacred head;<br> For Juno’s love, and Somnus’ pleasing ties,<br>            Have closed those awful and eternal eyes.”<br> Thus having said, the power of slumber flew,<br> On human lids to drop the balmy dew.<br> Neptune, with zeal increased, renews his care,<br> And towering in the foremost ranks of war,<br> Indignant
            thus—“Oh once of martial fame!<br> O Greeks! if yet ye can deserve the name!<br> This half-recover’d day shall Troy obtain?<br> Shall Hector thunder at your ships again?<br> Lo! still he vaunts, and threats the fleet with fires,<br> While
            stern Achilles in his wrath retires.<br> One hero’s loss too tamely you deplore,<br> Be still yourselves, and ye shall need no more.<br> Oh yet, if glory any bosom warms,<br> Brace on your firmest helms, and stand to arms:<br> His strongest
            spear each valiant Grecian wield,<br> Each valiant Grecian seize his broadest shield;<br> Let to the weak the lighter arms belong,<br> The ponderous targe be wielded by the strong.<br> Thus arm’d, not Hector shall our presence stay;<br> Myself,
            ye Greeks! myself will lead the way.”

            ARGUMENT.

        <p class="center">
            THE FIFTH BATTLE AT THE SHIPS; AND THE ACTS OF AJAX.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            Jupiter, awaking, sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches, Hector in a swoon, and Neptune at the head of the Greeks: he is highly incensed at the artifice of Juno, who appeases him by her submissions; she is then sent to Iris and Apollo. Juno, repairing
            to the assembly of the gods, attempts, with extraordinary address, to incense them against Jupiter; in particular she touches Mars with a violent resentment; he is ready to take arms, but is prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apollo obey the orders
            of Jupiter; Iris commands Neptune to leave the battle, to which, after much reluctance and passion, he consents. Apollo reinspires Hector with vigour, brings him back to the battle, marches before him with his aegis, and turns the fortune
            of the fight. He breaks down great part of the Grecian wall: the Trojans rush in, and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but are, as yet, repelled by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Now in swift flight they pass the trench profound,<br> And many a chief lay gasping on the ground:<br> Then stopp’d and panted, where the chariots lie<br> Fear on their cheek, and horror in their eye.<br> Meanwhile, awaken’d from his dream
            of love,<br> On Ida’s summit sat imperial Jove:<br> Round the wide fields he cast a careful view,<br> There saw the Trojans fly, the Greeks pursue;<br> These proud in arms, those scatter’d o’er the plain<br> And, ’midst the war, the monarch
            of the main.<br> Not far, great Hector on the dust he spies,<br> (His sad associates round with weeping eyes,)<br> Ejecting blood, and panting yet for breath,<br> His senses wandering to the verge of death.<br> The god beheld him with a pitying
            look,
            <br> And thus, incensed, to fraudful Juno spoke:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O thou, still adverse to the eternal will,<br> For ever studious in promoting ill!<br> Thy arts have made the godlike Hector yield,<br> And driven his conquering squadrons from the field.<br> Canst thou, unhappy in thy wiles, withstand<br>            Our power immense, and brave the almighty hand?<br> Hast thou forgot, when, bound and fix’d on high,<br> From the vast concave of the spangled sky,<br> I hung thee trembling in a golden chain,<br> And all the raging gods opposed in vain?<br>            Headlong I hurl’d them from the Olympian hall,<br> Stunn’d in the whirl, and breathless with the fall.<br> For godlike Hercules these deeds were done,<br> Nor seem’d the vengeance worthy such a son:<br> When, by thy wiles induced, fierce Boreas
            toss’d
            <br> The shipwreck’d hero on the Coan coast,<br> Him through a thousand forms of death I bore,<br> And sent to Argos, and his native shore.<br> Hear this, remember, and our fury dread,<br> Nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head;<br>            Lest arts and blandishments successless prove,<br> Thy soft deceits, and well-dissembled love.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The Thunderer spoke: imperial Juno mourn’d,<br> And, trembling, these submissive words return’d:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “By every oath that powers immortal ties,<br> The foodful earth and all-infolding skies;<br> By thy black waves, tremendous Styx! that flow<br> Through the drear realms of gliding ghosts below;<br> By the dread honours of thy sacred head,<br>            And that unbroken vow, our virgin bed!<br> Not by my arts the ruler of the main<br> Steeps Troy in blood, and ranges round the plain:<br> By his own ardour, his own pity sway’d,<br> To help his Greeks, he fought and disobey’d:<br> Else had
            thy Juno better counsels given,<br> And taught submission to the sire of heaven.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Think’st thou with me? fair empress of the skies!<br> (The immortal father with a smile replies;)<br> Then soon the haughty sea-god shall obey,<br> Nor dare to act but when we point the way.<br> If truth inspires thy tongue, proclaim our
            will
            <br> To yon bright synod on the Olympian hill;<br> Our high decree let various Iris know,<br> And call the god that bears the silver bow.<br> Let her descend, and from the embattled plain<br> Command the sea-god to his watery reign:<br> While
            Phœbus hastes great Hector to prepare<br> To rise afresh, and once more wake the war:<br> His labouring bosom re-inspires with breath,<br> And calls his senses from the verge of death.<br> Greece chased by Troy, even to Achilles’ fleet,<br>            Shall fall by thousands at the hero’s feet.<br> He, not untouch’d with pity, to the plain<br> Shall send Patroclus, but shall send in vain.<br> What youths he slaughters under Ilion’s walls!<br> Even my loved son, divine Sarpedon, falls!<br>            Vanquish’d at last by Hector’s lance he lies.<br> Then, nor till then, shall great Achilles rise:<br> And lo! that instant, godlike Hector dies.<br> From that great hour the war’s whole fortune turns,<br> Pallas assists, and lofty Ilion burns.<br>            Not till that day shall Jove relax his rage,<br> Nor one of all the heavenly host engage<br> In aid of Greece. The promise of a god<br> I gave, and seal’d it with the almighty nod,<br> Achilles’ glory to the stars to raise;<br> Such was our
            word, and fate the word obeys.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The trembling queen (the almighty order given)<br> Swift from the Idaean summit shot to heaven.<br> As some wayfaring man, who wanders o’er<br> In thought a length of lands he trod before,<br> Sends forth his active mind from place to place,<br>            Joins hill to dale, and measures space with space:<br> So swift flew Juno to the bless’d abodes,<br> If thought of man can match the speed of gods.<br> There sat the powers in awful synod placed;<br> They bow’d, and made obeisance as she pass’d<br>            Through all the brazen dome:<a href="#fn239" name="fnref239"><sup>[239]</sup></a> with goblets crown’d<br> They hail her queen; the nectar streams around.<br> Fair Themis first presents the golden bowl,<br> And anxious asks what cares disturb
            her soul?
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To whom the white-arm’d goddess thus replies:<br> “Enough thou know’st the tyrant of the skies,<br> Severely bent his purpose to fulfil,<br> Unmoved his mind, and unrestrain’d his will.<br> Go thou, the feasts of heaven attend thy call;<br>            Bid the crown’d nectar circle round the hall:<br> But Jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome<br> Such stern decrees, such threaten’d woes to come,<br> As soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise,<br> And damp the eternal banquets
            of the skies.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The goddess said, and sullen took her place;<br> Black horror sadden’d each celestial face.<br> To see the gathering grudge in every breast,<br> Smiles on her lips a spleenful joy express’d;<br> While on her wrinkled front, and eyebrow bent,<br>            Sat stedfast care, and lowering discontent.<br> Thus she proceeds—“Attend, ye powers above!<br> But know, ’tis madness to contest with Jove:<br> Supreme he sits; and sees, in pride of sway.<br> Your vassal godheads grudgingly obey:<br> Fierce
            in the majesty of power controls;<br> Shakes all the thrones of heaven, and bends the poles.<br> Submiss, immortals! all he wills, obey:<br> And thou, great Mars, begin and show the way.<br> Behold Ascalaphus! behold him die,<br> But dare
            not murmur, dare not vent a sigh;<br> Thy own loved boasted offspring lies o’erthrown,<br> If that loved boasted offspring be thy own.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Stern Mars, with anguish for his slaughter’d son,<br> Smote his rebelling breast, and fierce begun:<br> “Thus then, immortals! thus shall Mars obey;<br> Forgive me, gods, and yield my vengeance way:<br> Descending first to yon forbidden plain,<br>            The god of battles dares avenge the slain;<br> Dares, though the thunder bursting o’er my head<br> Should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            With that he gives command to Fear and Flight<br> To join his rapid coursers for the fight:<br> Then grim in arms, with hasty vengeance flies;<br> Arms that reflect a radiance through the skies.<br> And now had Jove, by bold rebellion driven,<br>            Discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven;<br> But Pallas, springing through the bright abode,<br> Starts from her azure throne to calm the god.<br> Struck for the immortal race with timely fear,<br> From frantic Mars she snatch’d the
            shield and spear;<br> Then the huge helmet lifting from his head,<br> Thus to the impetuous homicide she said:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “By what wild passion, furious! art thou toss’d?<br> Striv’st thou with Jove? thou art already lost.<br> Shall not the Thunderer’s dread command restrain,<br> And was imperial Juno heard in vain?<br> Back to the skies wouldst thou with shame
            be driven,<br> And in thy guilt involve the host of heaven?<br> Ilion and Greece no more should Jove engage,<br> The skies would yield an ampler scene of rage;<br> Guilty and guiltless find an equal fate<br> And one vast ruin whelm the Olympian
            state.
            <br> Cease then thy offspring’s death unjust to call;<br> Heroes as great have died, and yet shall fall.<br> Why should heaven’s law with foolish man comply<br> Exempted from the race ordain’d to die?”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            This menace fix’d the warrior to his throne;<br> Sullen he sat, and curb’d the rising groan.<br> Then Juno call’d (Jove’s orders to obey)<br> The winged Iris, and the god of day.<br> “Go wait the Thunderer’s will (Saturnia cried)<br> On yon
            tall summit of the fountful Ide:<br> There in the father’s awful presence stand,<br> Receive, and execute his dread command.”

            <br> And famed for prowess in a well-fought field,<br> He pierced the centre of his sounding shield:<br> But Meges, Phyleus’ ample breastplate wore,<br> (Well-known in fight on Selle’s winding shore;<br> For king Euphetes gave the golden mail,<br>            Compact, and firm with many a jointed scale)<br> Which oft, in cities storm’d, and battles won,<br> Had saved the father, and now saves the son.<br> Full at the Trojan’s head he urged his lance,<br> Where the high plumes above the helmet dance,<br>            New ting’d with Tyrian dye: in dust below,<br> Shorn from the crest, the purple honours glow.<br> Meantime their fight the Spartan king survey’d,<br> And stood by Meges’ side a sudden aid.<br> Through Dolops’ shoulder urged his forceful dart,<br>            Which held its passage through the panting heart,<br> And issued at his breast. With thundering sound<br> The warrior falls, extended on the ground.<br> In rush the conquering Greeks to spoil the slain:<br> But Hector’s voice excites his kindred
            train;
            <br> The hero most, from Hicetaon sprung,<br> Fierce Melanippus, gallant, brave, and young.<br> He (ere to Troy the Grecians cross’d the main)<br> Fed his large oxen on Percote’s plain;<br> But when oppress’d, his country claim’d his care,
            <br> Return’d to Ilion, and excell’d in war;<br> For this, in Priam’s court, he held his place,<br> Beloved no less than Priam’s royal race.<br> Him Hector singled, as his troops he led,<br> And thus inflamed him, pointing to the dead.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Lo, Melanippus! lo, where Dolops lies;<br> And is it thus our royal kinsman dies?<br> O’ermatch’d he falls; to two at once a prey,<br> And lo! they bear the bloody arms away!<br> Come on—a distant war no longer wage,<br> But hand to hand
            thy country’s foes engage:<br> Till Greece at once, and all her glory end;<br> Or Ilion from her towery height descend,<br> Heaved from the lowest stone; and bury all<br> In one sad sepulchre, one common fall.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Hector (this said) rush’d forward on the foes:<br> With equal ardour Melanippus glows:<br> Then Ajax thus—“O Greeks! respect your fame,<br> Respect yourselves, and learn an honest shame:<br> Let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire,<br>            And catch from breast to breast the noble fire,<br> On valour’s side the odds of combat lie;<br> The brave live glorious, or lamented die;<br> The wretch that trembles in the field of fame,<br> Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            His generous sense he not in vain imparts;<br> It sunk, and rooted in the Grecian hearts:<br> They join, they throng, they thicken at his call,<br> And flank the navy with a brazen wall;<br> Shields touching shields, in order blaze above,<br>            And stop the Trojans, though impell’d by Jove.<br> The fiery Spartan first, with loud applause.<br> Warms the bold son of Nestor in his cause.<br> “Is there (he said) in arms a youth like you,<br> So strong to fight, so active to pursue?<br>            Why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?<br> Lift the bold lance, and make some Trojan bleed.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He said; and backward to the lines retired;<br> Forth rush’d the youth with martial fury fired,<br> Beyond the foremost ranks; his lance he threw,<br> And round the black battalions cast his view.<br> The troops of Troy recede with sudden
            fear,
            <br> While the swift javelin hiss’d along in air.<br> Advancing Melanippus met the dart<br> With his bold breast, and felt it in his heart:<br> Thundering he falls; his falling arms resound,<br> And his broad buckler rings against the ground.
            <br> The victor leaps upon his prostrate prize:<br> Thus on a roe the well-breath’d beagle flies,<br> And rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart<br> The distant hunter sent into his heart.<br> Observing Hector to the rescue flew;<br>            Bold as he was, Antilochus withdrew.<br> So when a savage, ranging o’er the plain,<br> Has torn the shepherd’s dog, or shepherd’s swain,<br> While conscious of the deed, he glares around,<br> And hears the gathering multitude resound,<br>            Timely he flies the yet-untasted food,<br> And gains the friendly shelter of the wood:<br> So fears the youth; all Troy with shouts pursue,<br> While stones and darts in mingled tempest flew;<br> But enter’d in the Grecian ranks, he turns<br>            His manly breast, and with new fury burns.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Now on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove,<br> Fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove:<br> The sire of gods, confirming Thetis’ prayer,<br> The Grecian ardour quench’d in deep despair;<br> But lifts to glory Troy’s prevailing bands,<br>            Swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.<br> On Ida’s top he waits with longing eyes,<br> To view the navy blazing to the skies;<br> Then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,<br> The Trojans fly, and conquer’d Ilion
            burn.
            <br> These fates revolved in his almighty mind,<br> He raises Hector to the work design’d,<br> Bids him with more than mortal fury glow,<br> And drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.<br> So Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,<br>            Shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.<br> Not with more rage a conflagration rolls,<br> Wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.<br> He foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow<br> Like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:<br>            The radiant helmet on his temple burns,<br> Waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:<br> For Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,<br> And cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.<br> Unhappy glories! for his fate was near,<br>            Due to stern Pallas, and Pelides’ spear:<br> Yet Jove deferr’d the death he was to pay,<br> And gave what fate allow’d, the honours of a day!
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes<br> Burn at each foe, and single every prize;<br> Still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,<br> He points his ardour, and exerts his might.<br> The Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,<br>            On all sides batter’d, yet resists his power:<br> So some tall rock o’erhangs the hoary main,<a href="#fn241" name="fnref241"><sup>[241]</sup></a><br> By winds assail’d, by billows beat in vain,<br> Unmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,<br>            And sees the watery mountains break below.<br> Girt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall<br> Like fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all:<br> Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,
            <br> And, swell’d with tempests, on the ship descends;<br> White are the decks with foam; the winds aloud<br> Howl o’er the masts, and sing through every shroud:<br> Pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;<br> And instant death
            on every wave appears.<br> So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet,<br> The chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.

            As when a lion, rushing from his den,<br> Amidst the plain of some wide-water’d fen,<br> (Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,<br> At large expatiate o’er the ranker mead)<br> Leaps on the herds before the herdsman’s eyes;<br> The trembling
            herdsman far to distance flies;<br> Some lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)<br> He singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.<br> Thus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew<br> All Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:<br> Mycenian

            ARGUMENT

        <p class="center">
            THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            Patroclus (in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book) entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greeks with Achilles’ troops and armour. He agrees to it, but at the same time charges him to content himself with rescuing
            the fleet, without further pursuit of the enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers are described. Achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend, after which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The Trojans, at the sight
            of Patroclus in Achilles’ armour, taking him for that hero, are cast into the uttermost consternation; he beats them off from the vessels, Hector himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter was averse to his fate. Several other particulars
            of the battle are described; in the heat of which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of Achilles, pursues the foe to the walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses and disarms him, Euphorbus wounds him, and Hector kills him, which concludes the book.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            So warr’d both armies on the ensanguined shore,<br> While the black vessels smoked with human gore.<br> Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies;<br> The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes.<br> Not faster, trickling to the plains below,<br>            From the tall rock the sable waters flow.<br> Divine Pelides, with compassion moved.<br> Thus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved:<a href="#fn243" name="fnref243"><sup>[243]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Patroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears,<br> That flows so fast in these unmanly tears?<br> No girl, no infant whom the mother keeps<br> From her loved breast, with fonder passion weeps;<br> Not more the mother’s soul, that infant warms,<br>            Clung to her knees, and reaching at her arms,<br> Than thou hast mine! Oh tell me, to what end<br> Thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend?
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Griev’st thou for me, or for my martial band?<br> Or come sad tidings from our native land?<br> Our fathers live (our first, most tender care),<br> Thy good Menoetius breathes the vital air,<br> And hoary Peleus yet extends his days;<br>            Pleased in their age to hear their children’s praise.<br> Or may some meaner cause thy pity claim?<br> Perhaps yon relics of the Grecian name,<br> Doom’d in their ships to sink by fire and sword,<br> And pay the forfeit of their haughty lord?<br>            Whate’er the cause, reveal thy secret care,<br> And speak those sorrows which a friend would share.”<br> A sigh that instant from his bosom broke,<br> Another follow’d, and Patroclus spoke:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Let Greece at length with pity touch thy breast,<br> Thyself a Greek; and, once, of Greeks the best!<br> Lo! every chief that might her fate prevent,<br> Lies pierced with wounds, and bleeding in his tent:<br> Eurypylus, Tydides, Atreus’
            son,
            <br> And wise Ulysses, at the navy groan,<br> More for their country’s wounds than for their own.<br> Their pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease,<br> Thy breast alone no lenitives appease.<br> May never rage like thine my soul enslave,<br>            O great in vain! unprofitably brave!<br> Thy country slighted in her last distress,<br> What friend, what man, from thee shall hope redress?<br> No—men unborn, and ages yet behind,<br> Shall curse that fierce, that unforgiving mind.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O man unpitying! if of man thy race;<br> But sure thou spring’st not from a soft embrace,<br> Nor ever amorous hero caused thy birth,<br> Nor ever tender goddess brought thee forth:<br> Some rugged rock’s hard entrails gave thee form,<br>            And raging seas produced thee in a storm,<br> A soul well suiting that tempestuous kind,<br> So rough thy manners, so untamed thy mind.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “If some dire oracle thy breast alarm,<br> If aught from Jove, or Thetis, stop thy arm,<br> Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,<br> If I but lead the Myrmidonian line:<br> Clad in thy dreadful arms if I appear,<br> Proud Troy shall
            tremble, and desert the war;<br> Without thy person Greece shall win the day,<br> And thy mere image chase her foes away.<br> Press’d by fresh forces, her o’erlabour’d train<br> Shall quit the ships, and Greece respire again.”<br> Thus, blind
            to fate! with supplicating breath,<br> Thou begg’st his arms, and in his arms thy death.<br> Unfortunately good! a boding sigh<br> Thy friend return’d; and with it, this reply:<br> “Patroclus! thy Achilles knows no fears;<br> Nor words from
            Jove nor oracles he hears;<br> Nor aught a mother’s caution can suggest;<br> The tyrant’s pride lies rooted in my breast.<br> My wrongs, my wrongs, my constant thought engage,<br> Those, my sole oracles, inspire my rage:<br> I made him tyrant:
            gave him power to wrong<br> Even me: I felt it; and shall feel it long.<br> The maid, my black-eyed maid, he forced away,<br> Due to the toils of many a well-fought day;<br> Due to my conquest of her father’s reign;<br> Due to the votes of
            all the Grecian train.<br> From me he forced her; me, the bold and brave,<br> Disgraced, dishonour’d, like the meanest slave.<br> But bear we this—the wrongs I grieve are past;<br> ’Tis time our fury should relent at last:<br> I fix’d its
            date; the day I wish’d appears:<br> How Hector to my ships his battle bears,<br> The flames my eyes, the shouts invade my ears.<br> Go then, Patroclus! court fair honour’s charms<br> In Troy’s famed fields, and in Achilles’ arms:<br> Lead
            forth my martial Myrmidons to fight,<br> Go save the fleets, and conquer in my right.<br> See the thin relics of their baffled band<br> At the last edge of yon deserted land!<br> Behold all Ilion on their ships descends;<br> How the cloud
            blackens, how the storm impends!<br> It was not thus, when, at my sight amazed,<br> Troy saw and trembled, as this helmet blazed:<br> Had not the injurious king our friendship lost,<br> Yon ample trench had buried half her host.<br> No camps,
            no bulwarks now the Trojans fear,<br> Those are not dreadful, no Achilles there;<br> No longer flames the lance of Tydeus’ son;<br> No more your general calls his heroes on:<br> Hector, alone, I hear; his dreadful breath<br> Commands your
            slaughter, or proclaims your death.<br> Yet now, Patroclus, issue to the plain:<br> Now save the ships, the rising fires restrain,<br> And give the Greeks to visit Greece again.<br> But heed my words, and mark a friend’s command,<br> Who trusts
            his fame and honours in thy hand,<br> And from thy deeds expects the Achaian host<br> Shall render back the beauteous maid he lost:<br> Rage uncontroll’d through all the hostile crew,<br> But touch not Hector, Hector is my due.<br> Though
            Jove in thunder should command the war,<br> Be just, consult my glory, and forbear.<br> The fleet once saved, desist from further chase,<br> Nor lead to Ilion’s walls the Grecian race;<br> Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy;<br> Some
            god, like Phœbus, ever kind to Troy.<br> Let Greece, redeem’d from this destructive strait,<br> Do her own work; and leave the rest to fate.<br> O! would to all the immortal powers above,<br> Apollo, Pallas, and almighty Jove!<br> That not
            one Trojan might be left alive,<br> And not a Greek of all the race survive:<br> Might only we the vast destruction shun,<br> And only we destroy the accursed town!”<br> Such conference held the chiefs; while on the strand<br> Great Jove with
            conquest crown’d the Trojan band.<br> Ajax no more the sounding storm sustain’d,<br> So thick the darts an iron tempest rain’d:<br> On his tired arm the weighty buckler hung;<br> His hollow helm with falling javelins rung;<br> His breath,
            in quick short pantings, comes and goes;<br> And painful sweat from all his members flows.<br> Spent and o’erpower’d, he barely breathes at most;<br> Yet scarce an army stirs him from his post;<br> Dangers on dangers all around him glow,<br>            And toil to toil, and woe succeeds to woe.

            Stern Hector waved his sword, and standing near,<br> Where furious Ajax plied his ashen spear,<br> Full on the lance a stroke so justly sped,<br> That the broad falchion lopp’d its brazen head;<br> His pointless spear the warrior shakes in

            fiery shower;<br> O’er the high stern the curling volumes rise,<br> And sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies.

        <p class="verse">
            Divine Achilles view’d the rising flames,<br> And smote his thigh, and thus aloud exclaims:<br> “Arm, arm, Patroclus!

            javelin stands,<br> Not to be poised but by Pelides’ hands:<br> From Pelion’s shady brow the plant entire<br> Old Chiron rent, and shaped it for his sire;<br> Whose son’s great arm alone the weapon wields,<br> The death of heroes, and the

            <br> Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,<br> Breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:<br> The lance arrests him with a mortal wound;<br> He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.<br> With him all Greece was sunk;
            that moment all<br> Her yet-surviving heroes seem’d to fall.<br> So, scorch’d with heat, along the desert score,<br> The roaming lion meets a bristly boar,<br> Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,<br> With flaming eyes, and jaws
            besmear’d with blood;<br> At length the sovereign savage wins the strife;<br> And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.<br> Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o’erthrown,<br> So many lives effused, expires his own.<br> As dying now at Hector’s
            feet he lies,<br> He sternly views him, and triumphant cries:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy<br> Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy;<br> The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames,<br> And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.<br> Unthinking man! I fought those towers
            to free,<br> And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:<br> But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made;<br> Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid;<br> Though much at parting that great chief might say,<br> And much enjoin thee, this
            important day.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            ‘Return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said),<br> Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.’<br> He spoke, Patroclus march’d, and thus he sped.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,<br> With faint, expiring breath, the chief replies:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine!<br> Jove’s and Apollo’s is this deed, not thine;<br> To heaven is owed whate’er your own you call,<br> And heaven itself disarm’d me ere my fall.<br> Had twenty mortals, each thy match in might,<br>            Opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight:<br> By fate and Phœbus was I first o’erthrown,<br> Euphorbus next; the third mean part thy own.<br> But thou, imperious! hear my latest breath;<br> The gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death:<br>            Insulting man, thou shalt be soon as I;<br> Black fate o’erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh;<br> Even now on life’s last verge I see thee stand,<br> I see thee fall, and by Achilles’ hand.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He faints: the soul unwilling wings her way,<br> (The beauteous body left a load of clay)<br> Flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast;<br> A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then Hector pausing, as his eyes he fed<br> On the pale carcase, thus address’d the dead:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “From whence this boding speech, the stern decree<br> Of death denounced, or why denounced to me?<br> Why not as well Achilles’ fate be given<br> To Hector’s lance? Who knows the will of heaven?”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Pensive he said; then pressing as he lay<br> His breathless bosom, tore the lance away;<br> And upwards cast the corse: the reeking spear<br> He shakes, and charges the bold charioteer.<br> But swift Automedon with loosen’d reins<br> Rapt
            in the chariot o’er the distant plains,<br> Far from his rage the immortal coursers drove;<br> The immortal coursers were the gift of Jove.<br>

            ARGUMENT.
        </p>

        <p class="center">
            THE SEVENTH BATTLE, FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.—THE ACTS OF MENELAUS.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            Menelaus, upon the death of Patroclus, defends his body from the enemy: Euphorbus, who attempts it, is slain. Hector advancing, Menelaus retires; but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This, Glaucus objects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon
            puts on the armour he had won from Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till Ajax rallies them: Æneas sustains the Trojans. Æneas and Hector attempt the chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The horses of
            Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his body with a thick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion. Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus’ death: then returns to the fight, where, though
            attacked with the utmost fury, he and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body to the ships.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies in the fields before Troy.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,<br> Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.<br> Great Menelaus, touch’d with generous woe,<br> Springs to the front, and guards him from the foe.<br> Thus round her new-fallen young the heifer
            moves,
            <br> Fruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves;<br> And anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)<br> Turns, and re-turns her, with a mother’s care,<br> Opposed to each that near the carcase came,<br> His broad shield glimmers, and his
            lances flame.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The son of Panthus, skill’d the dart to send,<br> Eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.<br> “This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low;<br> Warrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:<br> To me the spoils my prowess won, resign:<br> Depart
            with life, and leave the glory mine.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn’d<br> With generous anguish, and in scorn return’d:<br> “Laugh’st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne,<br> When mortals boast of prowess not their own?<br> Not thus the lion glories in his might,<br>            Nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,<br> Nor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)<br> Man only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.<br> But far the vainest of the boastful kind,<br> These sons of Panthus vent their haughty
            mind.
            <br> Yet ’twas but late, beneath my conquering steel<br> This boaster’s brother, Hyperenor, fell;<br> Against our arm which rashly he defied,<br> Vain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.<br> These eyes beheld him on the dust expire,<br>            No more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.<br> Presumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,<br> Go, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;<br> Or, while thou may’st, avoid the threaten’d fate;<br> Fools stay to feel it, and are wise
            too late.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Unmoved, Euphorbus thus: “That action known,<br> Come, for my brother’s blood repay thy own.<br> His weeping father claims thy destined head,<br> And spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.<br> On these thy conquer’d spoils I shall bestow,<br>            To soothe a consort’s and a parent’s woe.<br> No longer then defer the glorious strife,<br> Let heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Swift as the word the missile lance he flings;<br> The well-aim’d weapon on the buckler rings,<br> But blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.<br> On Jove the father great Atrides calls,<br> Nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,<br> It
            pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;<br> Wide through the neck appears the grisly wound,<br> Prone sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.<br> The shining circlets of his golden hair,<br> Which even the Graces might be proud to
            wear,
            <br> Instarr’d with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,<br> With dust dishonour’d, and deform’d with gore.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            As the young olive, in some sylvan scene,<br> Crown’d by fresh fountains with eternal green,<br> Lifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,<br> And plays and dances to the gentle air;<br> When lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades<br>            The tender plant, and withers all its shades;<br> It lies uprooted from its genial bed,<br> A lovely ruin now defaced and dead:<br> Thus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay,<br> While the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.<br> Proud of his
            deed, and glorious in the prize,<br> Affrighted Troy the towering victor flies:<br> Flies, as before some mountain lion’s ire<br> The village curs and trembling swains retire,<br> When o’er the slaughter’d bull they hear him roar,<br> And
            see his jaws distil with smoking gore:<br> All pale with fear, at distance scatter’d round,<br> They shout incessant, and the vales resound.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Meanwhile Apollo view’d with envious eyes,<br> And urged great Hector to dispute the prize;<br> (In Mentes’ shape, beneath whose martial care<br> The rough Ciconians learn’d the trade of war;)<a href="#fn247" name="fnref247"><sup>[247]</sup></a><br>            “Forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase<br> Achilles’ coursers, of ethereal race;<br> They stoop not, these, to mortal man’s command,<br> Or stoop to none but great Achilles’ hand.<br> Too long amused with a pursuit so vain,<br>            Turn, and behold the brave Euphorbus slain;<br> By Sparta slain! for ever now suppress’d<br> The fire which burn’d in that undaunted breast!”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus having spoke, Apollo wing’d his flight,<br> And mix’d with mortals in the toils of fight:<br> His words infix’d unutterable care<br> Deep in great Hector’s soul: through all the war<br> He darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view’d<br>            The breathless hero in his blood imbued,<br> (Forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay)<br> And in the victor’s hands the shining prey.<br> Sheath’d in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,<br> And sends his voice in thunder to
            the skies:<br> Fierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent,<br> It flew, and fired the nations as it went.<br> Atrides from the voice the storm divined,<br> And thus explored his own unconquer’d mind:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plain,<br> Slain in my cause, and for my honour slain!<br> Desert the arms, the relics, of my friend?<br> Or singly, Hector and his troops attend?<br> Sure where such partial favour heaven bestow’d,<br>            To brave the hero were to brave the god:<br> Forgive me, Greece, if once I quit the field;<br> ’Tis not to Hector, but to heaven I yield.<br> Yet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear,<br> Did but the voice of Ajax reach my ear:<br>            Still would we turn, still battle on the plains,<br> And give Achilles all that yet remains<br> Of his and our Patroclus—” This, no more<br> The time allow’d: Troy thicken’d on the shore.<br> A sable scene! The terrors Hector led.<br> Slow
            he recedes, and sighing quits the dead.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            So from the fold the unwilling lion parts,<br> Forced by loud clamours, and a storm of darts;<br> He flies indeed, but threatens as he flies,<br> With heart indignant and retorted eyes.<br> Now enter’d in the Spartan ranks, he turn’d<br> His
            manly breast, and with new fury burn’d;<br> O’er all the black battalions sent his view,<br> And through the cloud the godlike Ajax knew;<br> Where labouring on the left the warrior stood,<br> All grim in arms, and cover’d o’er with blood;<br>            There breathing courage, where the god of day<br> Had sunk each heart with terror and dismay.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To him the king: “Oh Ajax, oh my friend!<br> Haste, and Patroclus’ loved remains defend:<br> The body to Achilles to restore<br> Demands our care; alas, we can no more!<br> For naked now, despoiled of arms, he lies;<br> And Hector glories
            in the dazzling prize.”<br> He said, and touch’d his heart. The raging pair<br> Pierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.<br> Already had stern Hector seized his head,<br> And doom’d to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;<br> But soon as Ajax
            rear’d his tower-like shield,<br> Sprung to his car, and measured back the field,<br> His train to Troy the radiant armour bear,<br> To stand a trophy of his fame in war.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Meanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display’d)<br> Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;<br> And now before, and now behind he stood:<br> Thus in the centre of some gloomy wood,<br> With many a step, the lioness surrounds<br> Her
            tawny young, beset by men and hounds;<br> Elate her heart, and rousing all her powers,<br> Dark o’er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.<br> Fast by his side the generous Spartan glows<br> With great revenge, and feeds his inward woes.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids,<br> On Hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Where now in Hector shall we Hector find?<br> A manly form, without a manly mind.<br> Is this, O chief! a hero’s boasted fame?<br> How vain, without the merit, is the name!<br> Since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ<br> What other
            methods may preserve thy Troy:<br> ’Tis time to try if Ilion’s state can stand<br> By thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand:<br> Mean, empty boast! but shall the Lycians stake<br> Their lives for you? those Lycians you forsake?<br> What from
            thy thankless arms can we expect?<br> Thy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect;<br> Say, shall our slaughter’d bodies guard your walls,<br> While unreveng’d the great Sarpedon falls?<br> Even where he died for Troy, you left him there,<br>            A feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.<br> On my command if any Lycian wait,<br> Hence let him march, and give up Troy to fate.<br> Did such a spirit as the gods impart<br> Impel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart,<br> (Such as should burn
            in every soul that draws<br> The sword for glory, and his country’s cause)<br> Even yet our mutual arms we might employ,<br> And drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy.<br> Oh! were Patroclus ours, we might obtain<br> Sarpedon’s arms and honour’d
            corse again!<br> Greece with Achilles’ friend should be repaid,<br> And thus due honours purchased to his shade.<br> But words are vain—Let Ajax once appear,<br> And Hector trembles and recedes with fear;<br> Thou dar’st not meet the terrors
            of his eye;<br> And lo! already thou prepar’st to fly.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The Trojan chief with fix’d resentment eyed<br> The Lycian leader, and sedate replied:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Say, is it just, my friend, that Hector’s ear<br> From such a warrior such a speech should hear?<br> I deem’d thee once the wisest of thy kind,<br> But ill this insult suits a prudent mind.<br> I shun great Ajax? I desert my train?<br> ’Tis
            mine to prove the rash assertion vain;<br> I joy to mingle where the battle bleeds,<br> And hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.<br> But Jove’s high will is ever uncontroll’d,<br> The strong he withers, and confounds the bold;<br> Now
            crowns with fame the mighty man, and now<br> Strikes the fresh garland from the victor’s brow!<br> Come, through yon squadrons let us hew the way,<br> And thou be witness, if I fear to-day;<br> If yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread,<br>            Or yet their hero dare defend the dead.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then turning to the martial hosts, he cries:<br> “Ye Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies!<br> Be men, my friends, in action as in name,<br> And yet be mindful of your ancient fame.<br> Hector in proud Achilles’ arms shall shine,<br> Torn
            from his friend, by right of conquest mine.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He strode along the field, as thus he said:<br> (The sable plumage nodded o’er his head:)<br> Swift through the spacious plain he sent a look;<br> One instant saw, one instant overtook<br> The distant band, that on the sandy shore<br> The
            radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.<br> There his own mail unbraced the field bestrow’d;<br> His train to Troy convey’d the massy load.<br> Now blazing in the immortal arms he stands;<br> The work and present of celestial hands;<br> By aged
            Peleus to Achilles given,<br> As first to Peleus by the court of heaven:<br> His father’s arms not long Achilles wears,<br> Forbid by fate to reach his father’s years.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Him, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,<br> The god whose thunder rends the troubled air<br> Beheld with pity; as apart he sat,<br> And, conscious, look’d through all the scene of fate.<br> He shook the sacred honours of his head;<br>            Olympus trembled, and the godhead said;<br> “Ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end!<br> A moment’s glory; and what fates attend!<br> In heavenly panoply divinely bright<br> Thou stand’st, and armies tremble at thy sight,<br> As at Achilles’
            self! beneath thy dart<br> Lies slain the great Achilles’ dearer part.<br> Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,<br> Which once the greatest of mankind had worn.<br> Yet live! I give thee one illustrious day,<br> A blaze of glory
            ere thou fad’st away.<br> For ah! no more Andromache shall come<br> With joyful tears to welcome Hector home;<br> No more officious, with endearing charms,<br> From thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides’ arms!”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then with his sable brow he gave the nod<br> That seals his word; the sanction of the god.<br> The stubborn arms (by Jove’s command disposed)<br> Conform’d spontaneous, and around him closed:<br> Fill’d with the god, enlarged his members grew,<br>            Through all his veins a sudden vigour flew,<br> The blood in brisker tides began to roll,<br> And Mars himself came rushing on his soul.<br> Exhorting loud through all the field he strode,<br> And look’d, and moved, Achilles, or a god.<br>            Now Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, he inspires,<br> Now Phorcys, Chromius, and Hippothous fires;<br> The great Thersilochus like fury found,<br> Asteropaeus kindled at the sound,<br> And Ennomus, in augury renown’d.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Hear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber’d bands<br> Of neighbouring nations, or of distant lands!<br> ’Twas not for state we summon’d you so far,<br> To boast our numbers, and the pomp of war:<br> Ye came to fight; a valiant foe to chase,<br>            To save our present, and our future race.<br> For this, our wealth, our products, you enjoy,<br> And glean the relics of exhausted Troy.<br> Now then, to conquer or to die prepare;<br> To die or conquer are the terms of war.<br> Whatever hand
            shall win Patroclus slain,<br> Whoe’er shall drag him to the Trojan train,<br> With Hector’s self shall equal honours claim;<br> With Hector part the spoil, and share the fame.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Fired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,<br> They join, they thicken, they protend their spears;<br> Full on the Greeks they drive in firm array,<br> And each from Ajax hopes the glorious prey:<br> Vain hope! what numbers shall
            the field o’erspread,<br> What victims perish round the mighty dead!
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Great Ajax mark’d the growing storm from far,<br> And thus bespoke his brother of the war:<br> “Our fatal day, alas! is come, my friend;<br> And all our wars and glories at an end!<br> ’Tis not this corse alone we guard in vain,<br> Condemn’d
            to vultures on the Trojan plain;<br> We too must yield: the same sad fate must fall<br> On thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all.<br> See what a tempest direful Hector spreads,<br> And lo! it bursts, it thunders on our heads!<br> Call on
            our Greeks, if any hear the call,<br> The bravest Greeks: this hour demands them all.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The warrior raised his voice, and wide around<br> The field re-echoed the distressful sound.<br> “O chiefs! O princes, to whose hand is given<br> The rule of men; whose glory is from heaven!<br> Whom with due honours both Atrides grace:<br>            Ye guides and guardians of our Argive race!<br> All, whom this well-known voice shall reach from far,<br> All, whom I see not through this cloud of war;<br> Come all! let generous rage your arms employ,<br> And save Patroclus from the dogs
            of Troy.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Oilean Ajax first the voice obey’d,<br> Swift was his pace, and ready was his aid:<br> Next him Idomeneus, more slow with age,<br> And Merion, burning with a hero’s rage.<br> The long-succeeding numbers who can name?<br> But all were Greeks,
            and eager all for fame.<br> Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng;<br> Whole Troy embodied rush’d with shouts along.<br> Thus, when a mountain billow foams and raves,<br> Where some swoln river disembogues his waves,<br> Full in
            the mouth is stopp’d the rushing tide,<br> The boiling ocean works from side to side,<br> The river trembles to his utmost shore,<br> And distant rocks re-bellow to the roar.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Nor less resolved, the firm Achaian band<br> With brazen shields in horrid circle stand.<br> Jove, pouring darkness o’er the mingled fight,<br> Conceals the warriors’ shining helms in night:<br> To him, the chief for whom the hosts contend<br>            Had lived not hateful, for he lived a friend:<br> Dead he protects him with superior care.<br> Nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air.

            near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;<br> Then ran the mournful message to impart,<br> With tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.

            THE GRIEF OF ACHILLES, AND NEW ARMOUR MADE HIM BY VULCAN.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            The news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles by Antilochus. Thetis, hearing his lamentations, comes with all her sea- nymphs to comfort him. The speeches of the mother and son on this occasion. Iris appears to Achilles by the command of Juno,
            and orders him to show himself at the head of the intrenchments. The sight of him turns the fortunes of the day, and the body of Patroclus is carried off by the Greeks. The Trojans call a council, where Hector and Polydamas disagree in their
            opinions: but the advice of the former prevails, to remain encamped in the field. The grief of Achilles over the body of Patroclus.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son.
            The description of the wonderful works of Vulcan: and, lastly, that noble one of the shield of Achilles.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, and the night ensuing, take up this book: the scene is at Achilles’
            tent on the sea-shore, from whence it changes to the palace of Vulcan.

        <p class="verse">
            Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,<a href="#fn250" name="fnref250"><sup>[250]</sup></a><br> And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.<br> Meanwhile, where Hellespont’s broad waters flow,
            <br> Stood Nestor’s son, the messenger of woe:<br> There sat Achilles, shaded by his sails,<br> On hoisted yards extended to the gales;<br> Pensive he sat; for all that fate design’d<br> Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.<br> Thus to
            his soul he said: “Ah! what constrains<br> The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains?<br> Is this the day, which heaven so long ago<br> Ordain’d, to sink me with the weight of woe?<br> (So Thetis warn’d;) when by a Trojan hand<br> The
            bravest of the Myrmidonian band<br> Should lose the light! Fulfilled is that decree;<br> Fallen is the warrior, and Patroclus he!<br> In vain I charged him soon to quit the plain,<br> And warn’d to shun Hectorean force in vain!”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus while he thinks, Antilochus appears,<br> And tells the melancholy tale with tears.<br> “Sad tidings, son of Peleus! thou must hear;<br> And wretched I, the unwilling messenger!<br> Dead is Patroclus! For his corse they fight;<br> His
            naked corse: his arms are Hector’s right.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            A sudden horror shot through all the chief,<br> And wrapp’d his senses in the cloud of grief;<br> Cast on the ground, with furious hands he spread<br> The scorching ashes o’er his graceful head;<br> His purple garments, and his golden hairs,<br>            Those he deforms with dust, and these he tears;<br> On the hard soil his groaning breast he threw,<br> And roll’d and grovell’d, as to earth he grew.<br> The virgin captives, with disorder’d charms,<br> (Won by his own, or by Patroclus’ arms,)<br>            Rush’d from their tents with cries; and gathering round,<br> Beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground:<br> While Nestor’s son sustains a manlier part,<br> And mourns the warrior with a warrior’s heart;<br> Hangs on his arms, amidst
            his frantic woe,<br> And oft prevents the meditated blow.

        <p class="verse">
            “Hear me, and judge, ye sisters of the main!<br> How just a cause has Thetis to complain!<br> How wretched, were I mortal, were my fate!<br> How more than wretched in the immortal state!<br> Sprung from my bed a godlike hero came,<br> The
            bravest far that ever bore the name;<br> Like some fair olive, by my careful hand<br> He grew, he flourish’d and adorn’d the land!<br> To Troy I sent him: but the fates ordain<br> He never, never must return again.<br> So short a space the
            light of heaven to view,<br> So short, alas! and fill’d with anguish too!<br> Hear how his sorrows echo through the shore!<br> I cannot ease them, but I must deplore;<br> I go at least to bear a tender part,<br> And mourn my loved-one with
            a mother’s heart.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            She said, and left the caverns of the main,<br> All bathed in tears; the melancholy train<br> Attend her way.

        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Why mourns my son? thy late preferr’d request<br> The god has granted, and the Greeks distress’d:<br> Why mourns my son? thy anguish let me share,<br> Reveal the cause, and trust a parent’s care.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He, deeply groaning—“To this cureless grief,<br> Not even the Thunderer’s favour brings relief.<br> Patroclus—Ah!—say, goddess, can I boast<br> A pleasure now? revenge itself is lost;<br> Patroclus, loved of all my martial train,<br> Beyond
            mankind, beyond myself is slain!<br> Lost are those arms the gods themselves bestow’d<br> On Peleus; Hector bears the glorious load.<br> Cursed be that day, when all the powers above<br> Thy charms submitted to a mortal love:<br> O hadst thou
            still, a sister of the main,<br> Pursued the pleasures of the watery reign:<br> And happier Peleus, less ambitious, led<br> A mortal beauty to his equal bed!<br> Ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb<br> Had caused such sorrows past, and woes
            to come.<br> For soon, alas! that wretched offspring slain,<br> New woes, new sorrows, shall create again.<br> ’Tis not in fate the alternate now to give;<br> Patroclus dead, Achilles hates to live.<br> Let me revenge it on proud Hector’s
            heart,
            <br> Let his last spirit smoke upon my dart;<br> On these conditions will I breathe: till then,<br> I blush to walk among the race of men.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            A flood of tears, at this, the goddess shed:<br> “Ah then, I see thee dying, see thee dead!<br> When Hector falls, thou diest.”—“Let Hector die,<br> And let me fall! (Achilles made reply)<br> Far lies Patroclus from his native plain!<br> He
            fell, and falling, wish’d my aid in vain.<br> Ah then, since from this miserable day<br> I cast all hope of my return away;<br> Since, unrevenged, a hundred ghosts demand<br> The fate of Hector from Achilles’ hand;<br> Since here, for brutal
            courage far renown’d,<br> I live an idle burden to the ground,<br> (Others in council famed for nobler skill,<br> More useful to preserve, than I to kill,)<br> Let me—But oh! ye gracious powers above!<br> Wrath and revenge from men and gods
            remove:
            <br> Far, far too dear to every mortal breast,<br> Sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste:<br> Gathering like vapours of a noxious kind<br> From fiery blood, and darkening all the mind.<br> Me Agamemnon urged to deadly hate;<br> ’Tis past—I
            quell it; I resign to fate.<br> Yes—I will meet the murderer of my friend;<br> Or (if the gods ordain it) meet my end.<br> The stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun:<br> The great Alcides, Jove’s unequall’d son,<br> To Juno’s hate, at length
            resign’d his breath,<br> And sunk the victim of all-conquering death.<br> So shall Achilles fall! stretch’d pale and dead,<br> No more the Grecian hope, or Trojan dread!<br> Let me, this instant, rush into the fields,<br> And reap what glory
            life’s short harvest yields.<br> Shall I not force some widow’d dame to tear<br> With frantic hands her long dishevell’d hair?<br> Shall I not force her breast to heave with sighs,<br> And the soft tears to trickle from her eyes?<br> Yes,
            I shall give the fair those mournful charms—<br> In vain you hold me—Hence! my arms! my arms!—<br> Soon shall the sanguine torrent spread so wide,<br> That all shall know Achilles swells the tide.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “My son (coerulean Thetis made reply,<br> To fate submitting with a secret sigh,)<br> The host to succour, and thy friends to save,<br> Is worthy thee; the duty of the brave.<br> But canst thou, naked, issue to the plains?<br> Thy radiant
            arms the Trojan foe detains.<br> Insulting Hector bears the spoils on high,<br> But vainly glories, for his fate is nigh.<br> Yet, yet awhile thy generous ardour stay;<br> Assured, I meet thee at the dawn of day,<br> Charged with refulgent
            arms (a glorious load),<br> Vulcanian arms, the labour of a god.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then turning to the daughters of the main,<br> The goddess thus dismiss’d her azure train:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Ye sister Nereids! to your deeps descend;<br> Haste, and our father’s sacred seat attend;<br> I go to find the architect divine,<br> Where vast Olympus’ starry summits shine:<br> So tell our hoary sire”—This charge she gave:<br> The sea-green
            sisters plunge beneath the wave:<br> Thetis once more ascends the bless’d abodes,<br> And treads the brazen threshold of the gods.

            and ceremonies on that occasion. Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of Ulysses. The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles, where Briseïs laments
            over the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately refuses all repast, and gives himself up to lamentations for his friend. Minerva descends to strengthen him, by the order of Jupiter. He arms for the fight: his appearance described. He addresses
            himself to his horses, and reproaches them with the death of Patroclus. One of them is miraculously endued with voice, and inspired to prophesy his fate: but the hero, not astonished by that prodigy, rushes with fury to the combat.<br>            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thirtieth day. The scene is on the sea-shore.

            THE BATTLE OF THE GODS, AND THE ACTS OF ACHILLES.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            Jupiter, upon Achilles’ return to the battle, calls a council of the gods, and permits them to assist either party. The terrors of the combat described, when the deities are engaged. Apollo encourages Æneas to meet Achilles. After a long conversation,
            these two heroes encounter; but Æneas is preserved by the assistance of Neptune. Achilles falls upon the rest of the Trojans, and is upon the point of killing Hector, but Apollo conveys him away in a cloud. Achilles pursues the Trojans with
            a great slaughter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same day continues. The scene is in the field before Troy.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus round Pelides breathing war and blood<br> Greece, sheathed in arms, beside her vessels stood;<br> While near impending from a neighbouring height,<br> Troy’s black battalions wait the shock of fight.<br> Then Jove to Themis gives command,
            to call<br> The gods to council in the starry hall:<br> Swift o’er Olympus’ hundred hills she flies,<br> And summons all the senate of the skies.<br> These shining on, in long procession come<br> To Jove’s eternal adamantine dome.<br> Not
            one was absent, not a rural power<br> That haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower;<br> Each fair-hair’d dryad of the shady wood,<br> Each azure sister of the silver flood;<br> All but old Ocean, hoary sire! who keeps<br> His ancient seat
            beneath the sacred deeps.<br> On marble thrones, with lucid columns crown’d,<br> (The work of Vulcan,) sat the powers around.<br> Even he whose trident sways the watery reign<br> Heard the loud summons, and forsook the main,<br> Assumed his
            throne amid the bright abodes,<br> And question’d thus the sire of men and gods:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “What moves the god who heaven and earth commands,<br> And grasps the thunder in his awful hands,<br> Thus to convene the whole ethereal state?<br> Is Greece and Troy the subject in debate?<br> Already met, the louring hosts appear,<br> And
            death stands ardent on the edge of war.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “’Tis true (the cloud-compelling power replies)<br> This day we call the council of the skies<br> In care of human race; even Jove’s own eye<br> Sees with regret unhappy mortals die.<br> Far on Olympus’ top in secret state<br> Ourself will
            sit, and see the hand of fate<br> Work out our will. Celestial powers! descend,<br> And as your minds direct, your succour lend<br> To either host. Troy soon must lie o’erthrown,<br> If uncontroll’d Achilles fights alone:<br> Their troops
            but lately durst not meet his eyes;<br> What can they now, if in his rage he rise?<br> Assist them, gods! or Ilion’s sacred wall<br> May fall this day, though fate forbids the fall.”<br> He said, and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            On adverse parts the warring gods engage:<br> Heaven’s awful queen; and he whose azure round<br> Girds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown’d;<br> Hermes, of profitable arts the sire;<br> And Vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire:<br>            These to the fleet repair with instant flight;<br> The vessels tremble as the gods alight.<br> In aid of Troy, Latona, Phœbus came,<br> Mars fiery-helm’d, the laughter-loving dame,<br> Xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow,<br> And
            the chaste huntress of the silver bow.<br> Ere yet the gods their various aid employ,<br> Each Argive bosom swell’d with manly joy,<br> While great Achilles (terror of the plain),<br> Long lost to battle, shone in arms again.<br> Dreadful
            he stood in front of all his host;<br> Pale Troy beheld, and seem’d already lost;<br> Her bravest heroes pant with inward fear,<br> And trembling see another god of war.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            But when the powers descending swell’d the fight,<br> Then tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright<br> Varied each face: then Discord sounds alarms,<br> Earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.<br> Now through the trembling shores Minerva
            calls,
            <br> And now she thunders from the Grecian walls.<br> Mars hovering o’er his Troy, his terror shrouds<br> In gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds:<br> Now through each Trojan heart he fury pours<br> With voice divine, from Ilion’s topmost
            towers:
            <br> Now shouts to Simois, from her beauteous hill;<br> The mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Above, the sire of gods his thunder rolls,<br> And peals on peals redoubled rend the poles.<br> Beneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground;<br> The forests wave, the mountains nod around;<br> Through all their summits tremble Ida’s woods,<br>            And from their sources boil her hundred floods.<br> Troy’s turrets totter on the rocking plain,<br> And the toss’d navies beat the heaving main.<br> Deep in the dismal regions of the dead,<a href="#fn260" name="fnref260"><sup>[260]</sup></a><br>            The infernal monarch rear’d his horrid head,<br> Leap’d from his throne, lest Neptune’s arm should lay<br> His dark dominions open to the day,<br> And pour in light on Pluto’s drear abodes,<br> Abhorr’d by men, and dreadful even to gods.

        </div>

        <p class="verse">
            Such war the immortals wage; such horrors rend<br> The world’s vast concave, when the gods contend.<br> First silver-shafted Phœbus took the plain<br> Against blue Neptune, monarch of the main.<br> The god of arms his giant bulk display’d,<br>            Opposed to Pallas, war’s triumphant maid.<br> Against Latona march’d the son of May.<br> The quiver’d Dian, sister of the day,<br> (Her golden arrows sounding at her side,)<br> Saturnia, majesty of heaven, defied.<br> With fiery Vulcan last
            in battle stands<br> The sacred flood that rolls on golden sands;<br> Xanthus his name with those of heavenly birth,<br> But called Scamander by the sons of earth.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            While thus the gods in various league engage,<br> Achilles glow’d with more than mortal rage:<br> Hector he sought; in search of Hector turn’d<br> His eyes around, for Hector only burn’d;<br> And burst like lightning through the ranks, and
            vow’d
            <br> To glut the god of battles with his blood.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Æneas was the first who dared to stay;<br> Apollo wedged him in the warrior’s way,<br> But swell’d his bosom with undaunted might,<br> Half-forced and half-persuaded to the fight.<br> Like young Lycaon, of the royal line,<br> In voice and
            aspect, seem’d the power divine;<br> And bade the chief reflect, how late with scorn<br> In distant threats he braved the goddess-born.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then thus the hero of Anchises’ strain:<br> “To meet Pelides you persuade in vain:<br> Already have I met, nor void of fear<br> Observed the fury of his flying spear;<br> From Ida’s woods he chased us to the field,<br> Our force he scattered,
            and our herds he kill’d;<br> Lyrnessus, Pedasus in ashes lay;<br> But (Jove assisting) I survived the day:<br> Else had I sunk oppress’d in fatal fight<br> By fierce Achilles and Minerva’s might.<br> Where’er he moved, the goddess shone before,<br>            And bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore.<br> What mortal man Achilles can sustain?<br> The immortals guard him through the dreadful plain,<br> And suffer not his dart to fall in vain.<br> Were God my aid, this arm should check his power,<br>            Though strong in battle as a brazen tower.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            To whom the son of Jove: “That god implore,<br> And be what great Achilles was before.<br> From heavenly Venus thou deriv’st thy strain,<br> And he but from a sister of the main;<br> An aged sea-god father of his line;<br> But Jove himself
            the sacred source of thine.<br> Then lift thy weapon for a noble blow,<br> Nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            This said, and spirit breathed into his breast,<br> Through the thick troops the embolden’d hero press’d:<br> His venturous act the white-arm’d queen survey’d,<br> And thus, assembling all the powers, she said:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Behold an action, gods! that claims your care,<br> Lo great Æneas rushing to the war!<br> Against Pelides he directs his course,<br> Phœbus impels, and Phœbus gives him force.<br> Restrain his bold career; at least, to attend<br> Our favour’d
            hero, let some power descend.<br> To guard his life, and add to his renown,<br> We, the great armament of heaven, came down.<br> Hereafter let him fall, as Fates design,<br> That spun so short his life’s illustrious line:<a href="#fn262" name="fnref262"><sup>[262]</sup></a><br>            But lest some adverse god now cross his way,<br> Give him to know what powers assist this day:<br> For how shall mortal stand the dire alarms,<br> When heaven’s refulgent host appear in arms?”<a href="#fn263" name="fnref263"><sup>[263]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus she; and thus the god whose force can make<br> The solid globe’s eternal basis shake:<br> “Against the might of man, so feeble known,<br> Why should celestial powers exert their own?<br> Suffice from yonder mount to view the scene,<br>            And leave to war the fates of mortal men.<br> But if the armipotent, or god of light,<br> Obstruct Achilles, or commence the fight,<br> Thence on the gods of Troy we swift descend:<br> Full soon, I doubt not, shall the conflict end;<br> And
            these, in ruin and confusion hurl’d,<br> Yield to our conquering arms the lower world.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus having said, the tyrant of the sea,<br> Coerulean Neptune, rose, and led the way.<br> Advanced upon the field there stood a mound<br> Of earth congested, wall’d, and trench’d around;<br> In elder times to guard Alcides made,<br> (The
            work of Trojans, with Minerva’s aid,)<br> What time a vengeful monster of the main<br> Swept the wide shore, and drove him to the plain.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Here Neptune and the gods of Greece repair,<br> With clouds encompass’d, and a veil of air:<br> The adverse powers, around Apollo laid,<br> Crown the fair hills that silver Simois shade.<br> In circle close each heavenly party sat,<br> Intent
            to form the future scheme of fate;<br> But mix not yet in fight, though Jove on high<br> Gives the loud signal, and the heavens reply.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground;<br> The trampled centre yields a hollow sound:<br> Steeds cased in mail, and chiefs in armour bright,<br> The gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.<br> Amid both hosts (a dreadful space)
            appear,
            <br> There great Achilles; bold Æneas, here.<br> With towering strides Æneas first advanced;<br> The nodding plumage on his helmet danced:<br> Spread o’er his breast the fencing shield he bore,<br> And, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.
            <br> Not so Pelides; furious to engage,<br> He rush’d impetuous. Such the lion’s rage,<br> Who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,<br> Though all in arms the peopled city rise,<br> Stalks careless on, with unregarding pride;<br> Till
            at the length, by some brave youth defied,<br> To his bold spear the savage turns alone,<br> He murmurs fury with a hollow groan;<br> He grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around,<br> Lash’d by his tail his heaving sides resound;<br> He calls
            up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,<br> Resolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.<br> So fierce Achilles on Æneas flies;<br> So stands Æneas, and his force defies.<br> Ere yet the stern encounter join’d, begun<br> The seed of Thetis thus
            to Venus’ son:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Why comes Æneas through the ranks so far?<br> Seeks he to meet Achilles’ arm in war,<br> In hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,<br> And prove his merits to the throne of Troy?<br> Grant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,<br> The partial
            monarch may refuse the prize;<br> Sons he has many; those thy pride may quell:<br> And ’tis his fault to love those sons too well,<br> Or, in reward of thy victorious hand,<br> Has Troy proposed some spacious tract of land,<br> An ample forest,
            or a fair domain,<br> Of hills for vines, and arable for grain?<br> Even this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.<br> But can Achilles be so soon forgot?<br> Once (as I think) you saw this brandish’d spear,<br> And then the great Æneas seem’d
            to fear:<br> With hearty haste from Ida’s mount he fled,<br> Nor, till he reach’d Lyrnessus, turn’d his head.<br> Her lofty walls not long our progress stay’d;<br> Those, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:<br> In Grecian chains her captive
            race were cast;<br> ’Tis true, the great Æneas fled too fast.<br> Defrauded of my conquest once before,<br> What then I lost, the gods this day restore.<br> Go; while thou may’st, avoid the threaten’d fate;<br> Fools stay to feel it, and are
            wise too late.”

            Dardanus, the first from Jove:<br> Dardania’s walls he raised; for Ilion, then,<br> (The city since of many-languaged men,)<br> Was not.

            The king of ocean to the fight descends,<br> Through all the whistling darts his course he bends,<br> Swift interposed between the warrior flies,<br> And casts thick darkness o’er Achilles’ eyes.<a href="#fn267" name="fnref267"><sup>[267]</sup></a><br>            From great Æneas’ shield the spear he drew,<br> And at his master’s feet the weapon threw.<br> That done, with force divine he snatch’d on high<br> The Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,<br> Smooth-gliding without step, above the
            heads
            <br> Of warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:<br> Till at the battle’s utmost verge they light,<br> Where the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.<br> The godhead there (his heavenly form confess’d)<br> With words like these the panting
            chief address’d:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “What power, O prince! with force inferior far,<br> Urged thee to meet Achilles’ arm in war?<br> Henceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,<br> Defrauding fate of all thy fame to come.<br> But when the day decreed (for come it must)<br> Shall
            lay this dreadful hero in the dust,<br> Let then the furies of that arm be known,<br> Secure no Grecian force transcends thy own.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            With that, he left him wondering as he lay,<br> Then from Achilles chased the mist away:<br> Sudden, returning with a stream of light,<br> The scene of war came rushing on his sight.<br> Then thus, amazed; “What wonders strike my mind!<br>            My spear, that parted on the wings of wind,<br> Laid here before me! and the Dardan lord,<br> That fell this instant, vanish’d from my sword!<br> I thought alone with mortals to contend,<br> But powers celestial sure this foe defend.<br> Great
            as he is, our arms he scarce will try,<br> Content for once, with all his gods, to fly.<br> Now then let others bleed.” This said, aloud<br> He vents his fury and inflames the crowd:<br> “O Greeks! (he cries, and every rank alarms)<br> Join
            battle, man to man, and arms to arms!<br> ’Tis not in me, though favour’d by the sky,<br> To mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:<br> No god can singly such a host engage,<br> Not Mars himself, nor great Minerva’s rage.<br> But whatsoe’er
            Achilles can inspire,<br> Whate’er of active force, or acting fire;<br> Whate’er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;<br> All, all Achilles, Greeks! is yours to-day.<br> Through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,<br> And thin the squadrons
            with my single spear.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He said: nor less elate with martial joy,<br> The godlike Hector warm’d the troops of Troy:<br> “Trojans, to war! Think, Hector leads you on;<br> Nor dread the vaunts of Peleus’ haughty son.<br> Deeds must decide our fate. E’en these with
            words
            <br> Insult the brave, who tremble at their swords:<br> The weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,<br> But shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.<br> Nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,<br> Not though his heart were steel,
            his hands were fire;<br> That fire, that steel, your Hector should withstand,<br> And brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;<br> A wood of lances rises round his head,<br> Clamours on clamours tempest all the air,<br> They join, they throng, they thicken to the war.<br> But Phœbus warns him from high heaven to shun<br>            The single fight with Thetis’ godlike son;<br> More safe to combat in the mingled band,<br> Nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.<br> He hears, obedient to the god of light,<br> And, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then fierce Achilles, shouting to the skies,<br> On Troy’s whole force with boundless fury flies.<br> First falls Iphytion, at his army’s head;<br> Brave was the chief, and brave the host he led;<br> From great Otrynteus he derived his blood,<br>            His mother was a Nais, of the flood;<br> Beneath the shades of Tmolus, crown’d with snow,<br> From Hyde’s walls he ruled the lands below.<br> Fierce as he springs, the sword his head divides:<br> The parted visage falls on equal sides:<br>            With loud-resounding arms he strikes the plain;<br> While thus Achilles glories o’er the slain:

            THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.<a href="#fn269" name="fnref269"><sup>[269]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            The Trojans fly before Achilles, some towards the town, others to the river Scamander: he falls upon the latter with great slaughter: takes twelve captives alive, to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus; and kills Lycaon and Asteropeus. Scamander attacks
            him with all his waves: Neptune and Pallas assist the hero: Simois joins Scamander: at length Vulcan, by the instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river. This combat ended, the other gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achilles continues
            the slaughter, drives the rest into Troy: Agenor only makes a stand, and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo; who (to delude Achilles) takes upon him Agenor’s shape, and while he pursues him in that disguise, gives the Trojans an opportunity
            of retiring into their city.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream of Scamander.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            And now to Xanthus’ gliding stream they drove,<br> Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove.<br> The river here divides the flying train,<br> Part to the town fly diverse o’er the plain,<br> Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,<br>            Now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:<br> (These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds,<br> And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:)<br> Part plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars,<br> The flashing billows beat the whiten’d
            shores:
            <br> With cries promiscuous all the banks resound,<br> And here, and there, in eddies whirling round,<br> The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown’d.<br> As the scorch’d locusts from their fields retire,<br> While fast behind them
            runs the blaze of fire;<br> Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,<br> The clustering legions rush into the flood:<br> So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles’ force,<br> Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.<br> His bloody lance
            the hero casts aside,<br> (Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)<br> Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,<br> Arm’d with his sword, high brandish’d o’er the waves:<br> Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,<br> Deep groan’d
            the waters with the dying sound;<br> Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,<br> And the warm purple circled on the tide.<br> Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,<br> And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:<br> So the huge dolphin
            tempesting the main,<br> In shoals before him fly the scaly train,<br> Confusedly heap’d they seek their inmost caves,<br> Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.<br> Now, tired with slaughter, from the Trojan band<br> Twelve chosen
            youths he drags alive to land;<br> With their rich belts their captive arms restrains<br> (Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).<br> These his attendants to the ships convey’d,<br> Sad victims destined to Patroclus’ shade;
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then, as once more he plunged amid the flood,<br> The young Lycaon in his passage stood;<br> The son of Priam; whom the hero’s hand<br> But late made captive in his father’s land<br> (As from a sycamore, his sounding steel<br> Lopp’d the green
            arms to spoke a chariot wheel)<br> To Lemnos’ isle he sold the royal slave,<br> Where Jason’s son the price demanded gave;<br> But kind Eetion, touching on the shore,<br> The ransom’d prince to fair Arisbe bore.<br> Ten days were past, since
            in his father’s reign<br> He felt the sweets of liberty again;<br> The next, that god whom men in vain withstand<br> Gives the same youth to the same conquering hand<br> Now never to return! and doom’d to go<br> A sadder journey to the shades
            below.
            <br> His well-known face when great Achilles eyed,<br> (The helm and visor he had cast aside<br> With wild affright, and dropp’d upon the field<br> His useless lance and unavailing shield,)<br> As trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,<br>            And knock’d his faltering knees, the hero said:<br> “Ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view!<br> Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?<br> Sure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans kill’d<br> Rise from the shades, and brave me on the
            field;
            <br> As now the captive, whom so late I bound<br> And sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!<br> Not him the sea’s unmeasured deeps detain,<br> That bar such numbers from their native plain;<br> Lo! he returns. Try, then, my flying spear!
            <br> Try, if the grave can hold the wanderer;<br> If earth, at length this active prince can seize,<br> Earth, whose strong grasp has held down Hercules.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus while he spoke, the Trojan pale with fears<br> Approach’d, and sought his knees with suppliant tears<br> Loth as he was to yield his youthful breath,<br> And his soul shivering at the approach of death.<br> Achilles raised the spear,
            prepared to wound;<br> He kiss’d his feet, extended on the ground:<br> And while, above, the spear suspended stood,<br> Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,<br> One hand embraced them close, one stopp’d the dart,<br> While thus these
            melting words attempt his heart:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Thy well-known captive, great Achilles! see,<br> Once more Lycaon trembles at thy knee.<br> Some pity to a suppliant’s name afford,<br> Who shared the gifts of Ceres at thy board;<br> Whom late thy conquering arm to Lemnos bore,<br> Far from
            his father, friends, and native shore;<br> A hundred oxen were his price that day,<br> Now sums immense thy mercy shall repay.<br> Scarce respited from woes I yet appear,<br> And scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here;<br> Lo! Jove again
            submits me to thy hands,<br> Again, her victim cruel Fate demands!<br> I sprang from Priam, and Laothoe fair,<br> (Old Altes’ daughter, and Lelegia’s heir;<br> Who held in Pedasus his famed abode,<br> And ruled the fields where silver Satnio
            flow’d,)
            <br> Two sons (alas! unhappy sons) she bore;<br> For ah! one spear shall drink each brother’s gore,<br> And I succeed to slaughter’d Polydore.<br> How from that arm of terror shall I fly?<br> Some demon urges! ’tis my doom to die!<br> If ever
            yet soft pity touch’d thy mind,<br> Ah! think not me too much of Hector’s kind!<br> Not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath,<br> With his, who wrought thy loved Patroclus’ death.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            These words, attended with a shower of tears,<br> The youth address’d to unrelenting ears:<br> “Talk not of life, or ransom (he replies):<br> Patroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies:<br> In vain a single Trojan sues for grace;<br> But least,
            the sons of Priam’s hateful race.<br> Die then, my friend! what boots it to deplore?<br> The great, the good Patroclus is no more!<br> He, far thy better, was foredoom’d to die,<br> And thou, dost thou bewail mortality?<br> Seest thou not
            me, whom nature’s gifts adorn,<br> Sprung from a hero, from a goddess born?<br> The day shall come (which nothing can avert)<br> When by the spear, the arrow, or the dart,<br> By night, or day, by force, or by design,<br> Impending death and
            certain fate are mine!<br> Die then,”—He said; and as the word he spoke,<br> The fainting stripling sank before the stroke:<br> His hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear,<br> While all his trembling frame confess’d his fear:<br> Sudden,
            Achilles his broad sword display’d,<br> And buried in his neck the reeking blade.<br> Prone fell the youth; and panting on the land,<br> The gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand.<br> The victor to the stream the carcase gave,<br> And thus
            insults him, floating on the wave:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Lie there, Lycaon! let the fish surround<br> Thy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound:<br> There no sad mother shall thy funerals weep,<br> But swift Scamander roll thee to the deep,<br> Whose every wave some watery monster brings,<br>            To feast unpunish’d on the fat of kings.<br> So perish Troy, and all the Trojan line!<br> Such ruin theirs, and such compassion mine.<br> What boots ye now Scamander’s worshipp’d stream,<br> His earthly honours, and immortal name?<br> In vain
            your immolated bulls are slain,<br> Your living coursers glut his gulfs in vain!<br> Thus he rewards you, with this bitter fate;<br> Thus, till the Grecian vengeance is complete:<br> Thus is atoned Patroclus’ honour’d shade,<br> And the short
            absence of Achilles paid.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            These boastful words provoked the raging god;<br> With fury swells the violated flood.<br> What means divine may yet the power employ<br> To check Achilles, and to rescue Troy?<br> Meanwhile the hero springs in arms, to dare<br> The great
            Asteropeus to mortal war;<br> The son of Pelagon, whose lofty line<br> Flows from the source of Axius, stream divine!<br> (Fair Peribaea’s love the god had crown’d,<br> With all his refluent waters circled round:)<br> On him Achilles rush’d;
            he fearless stood,<br> And shook two spears, advancing from the flood;<br> The flood impell’d him, on Pelides’ head<br> To avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.<br> Near as they drew, Achilles thus began:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “What art thou, boldest of the race of man?<br> Who, or from whence? Unhappy is the sire<br> Whose son encounters our resistless ire.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “O son of Peleus! what avails to trace<br> (Replied the warrior) our illustrious race?<br> From rich Paeonia’s valleys I command,<br> Arm’d with protended spears, my native band;<br> Now shines the tenth bright morning since I came<br> In
            aid of Ilion to the fields of fame:<br> Axius, who swells with all the neighbouring rills,<br> And wide around the floated region fills,<br> Begot my sire, whose spear much glory won:<br> Now lift thy arm, and try that hero’s son!”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Threatening he said: the hostile chiefs advance;<br> At once Asteropeus discharged each lance,<br> (For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,)<br> One struck, but pierced not, the Vulcanian shield;<br> One razed Achilles’ hand; the
            spouting blood<br> Spun forth; in earth the fasten’d weapon stood.<br> Like lightning next the Pelean javelin flies:<br> Its erring fury hiss’d along the skies;<br> Deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,<br> Even to the middle earth;
            and quiver’d there.<br> Then from his side the sword Pelides drew,<br> And on his foe with double fury flew.<br> The foe thrice tugg’d, and shook the rooted wood;<br> Repulsive of his might the weapon stood:<br> The fourth, he tries to break
            the spear in vain;<br> Bent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain;<br> His belly open’d with a ghastly wound,<br> The reeking entrails pour upon the ground.<br> Beneath the hero’s feet he panting lies,<br> And his eye darkens, and his spirit
            flies;
            <br> While the proud victor thus triumphing said,<br> His radiant armour tearing from the dead:
        </p>

            offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)<br> In aid of him, beside the beech he sate,<br> And wrapt in clouds, restrain’d the hand of fate.<br> When now the generous youth Achilles spies,<br> Thick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.<br>            (So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)<br> He stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;

        <p class="verse">
            “What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!<br> Like others fly, and be like others slain?<br> Vain hope! to shun him by the self-same road<br> Yon line of slaughter’d Trojans lately trod.<br> No: with the common heap I scorn to fall—<br>            What if they pass’d me to the Trojan wall,<br> While I decline to yonder path, that leads<br> To Ida’s forests and surrounding shades?<br> So may I reach, conceal’d, the cooling flood,<br> From my tired body wash the dirt and blood,<br> As

            Achilles sees me, and I fall:<br> Such is his swiftness, ’tis in vain to fly,<br> And such his valour, that who stands must die.<br> Howe’er ’tis better, fighting for the state,<br> Here, and in public view, to meet my fate.<br> Yet sure he
            too is mortal; he may feel<br> (Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.<br> One only soul informs that dreadful frame:<br> And Jove’s sole favour gives him all his fame.”

        <p class="verse">

            THE DEATH OF HECTOR.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            The Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector only stays to oppose Achilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his son to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain. Hector consults within himself what measures
            to take; but at the advance of Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies. Achilles pursues him thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning the fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles. She deludes
            Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and is slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of Priam and Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries reach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant
            of this, was retired into the inner part of the palace: she mounts up to the walls, and beholds her dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and lamentation.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thirtieth day still
            continues. The scene lies under the walls, and on the battlements of Troy.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,<br> The herded Ilians rush like driven deer:<br> There safe they wipe the briny drops away,<br> And drown in bowls the labours of the day.<br> Close to the walls, advancing o’er the fields<br>            Beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,<br> March, bending on, the Greeks’ embodied powers,<br> Far stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.<br> Great Hector singly stay’d: chain’d down by fate<br> There fix’d he stood before the Scaean
            gate;
            <br> Still his bold arms determined to employ,<br> The guardian still of long-defended Troy.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Apollo now to tired Achilles turns:<br> (The power confess’d in all his glory burns:)<br> “And what (he cries) has Peleus’ son in view,<br> With mortal speed a godhead to pursue?<br> For not to thee to know the gods is given,<br> Unskill’d
            to trace the latent marks of heaven.<br> What boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?<br> Vain thy past labour, and thy present vain:<br> Safe in their walls are now her troops bestow’d,<br> While here thy frantic rage attacks a god.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The chief incensed—“Too partial god of day!<br> To check my conquests in the middle way:<br> How few in Ilion else had refuge found!<br> What gasping numbers now had bit the ground!<br> Thou robb’st me of a glory justly mine,<br> Powerful
            of godhead, and of fraud divine:<br> Mean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,<br> To cheat a mortal who repines in vain.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then to the city, terrible and strong,<br> With high and haughty steps he tower’d along,<br> So the proud courser, victor of the prize,<br> To the near goal with double ardour flies.<br> Him, as he blazing shot across the field,<br> The careful
            eyes of Priam first beheld.<br> Not half so dreadful rises to the sight,<a href="#fn274" name="fnref274"><sup>[274]</sup></a><br> Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,<br> Orion’s dog (the year when autumn weighs),<br> And o’er
            the feebler stars exerts his rays;<br> Terrific glory! for his burning breath<br> Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.<br> So flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:<br> He strikes his reverend head, now white with age;<br>            He lifts his wither’d arms; obtests the skies;<br> He calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:<br> The son, resolved Achilles’ force to dare,<br> Full at the Scaean gates expects the war;
            <br> While the sad father on the rampart stands,<br> And thus adjures him with extended hands:

        <p class="verse">
            “Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;<br> Hector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!<br> Methinks already I behold thee slain,<br> And stretch’d beneath that fury of the plain.<br> Implacable Achilles! might’st thou be<br> To all the
            gods no dearer than to me!<br> Thee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore,<br> And bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.<br> How many valiant sons I late enjoy’d,<br> Valiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy’d:<br> Or, worse than
            slaughtered, sold in distant isles<br> To shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.<br> Two, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,<br> Two from one mother sprung, my Polydore,<br> And loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!<br> Oh! if in yonder hostile
            camp they live,<br> What heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!<br> (Their grandsire’s wealth, by right of birth their own,<br> Consign’d his daughter with Lelegia’s throne:)<br> But if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,<br> All pale

            yet the wall;<br> And spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!<br> Save thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave<br> Neglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.<br> Pity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;<br> While yet thy father feels the
            woes he bears,<br> Yet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage<br> (All trembling on the verge of helpless age)<br> Great Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!<br> The bitter dregs of fortune’s cup to drain:<br> To fill with scenes
            of death his closing eyes,<br> And number all his days by miseries!<br> My heroes slain, my bridal bed o’erturn’d,<br> My daughters ravish’d, and my city burn’d,<br> My bleeding infants dash’d against the floor;<br> These I have yet to see,
            perhaps yet more!<br> Perhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,<br> The last sad relic of my ruin’d state,<br> (Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,<br> And stain the pavement of my regal hall;<br> Where famish’d dogs, late guardians
            of my door,<br> Shall lick their mangled master’s spatter’d gore.<br> Yet for my sons I thank ye, gods! ’tis well;<br> Well have they perish’d, for in fight they fell.<br> Who dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,<br> Struck through with
            wounds, all honest on the breast.<br> But when the fates, in fulness of their rage,<br> Spurn the hoar head of unresisting age,<br> In dust the reverend lineaments deform,<br> And pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:<br> This, this is
            misery! the last, the worse,<br> That man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He said, and acting what no words could say,<br> Rent from his head the silver locks away.<br> With him the mournful mother bears a part;<br> Yet all her sorrows turn not Hector’s heart.<br> The zone unbraced, her bosom she display’d;<br>            And thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Have mercy on me, O my son! revere<br> The words of age; attend a parent’s prayer!<br> If ever thee in these fond arms I press’d,<br> Or still’d thy infant clamours at this breast;<br> Ah do not thus our helpless years forego,<br> But, by
            our walls secured, repel the foe.<br> Against his rage if singly thou proceed,<br> Should’st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should’st thou bleed,<br> Nor must thy corse lie honour’d on the bier,<br> Nor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a
            tear!
            <br> Far from our pious rites those dear remains<br> Must feast the vultures on the naked plains.”

            So they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;<br> But fix’d remains the purpose of his soul;<br> Resolved he stands, and with a fiery glance<br> Expects the hero’s terrible advance.<br> So, roll’d up in his den, the swelling snake<br>            Beholds the traveller approach the brake;<br> When fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins<br> Have gather’d half the poisons of the plains;<br> He burns, he stiffens with collected ire,<br> And his red eyeballs glare with living fire.<br>            Beneath a turret, on his shield reclined,<br> He stood, and question’d thus his mighty mind:<a href="#fn275" name="fnref275"><sup>[275]</sup></a>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;<br> His dreadful plumage nodded from on high;<br> The Pelian javelin, in his better hand,<br> Shot trembling rays that glitter’d o’er the land;<br> And on his breast the beamy splendour shone,<br>            Like Jove’s own lightning, or the rising sun.<br> As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,<br> Struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.<br> He leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:<br> Achilles follows like the winged wind.<br>            Thus at the panting dove a falcon flies<br> (The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),<br> Just when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,<br> Obliquely wheeling through the aerial way,<br> With open beak and shrilling cries he springs,<br>            And aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:<br> No less fore-right the rapid chase they held,<br> One urged by fury, one by fear impell’d:<br> Now circling round the walls their course maintain,<br> Where the high watch-tower overlooks

            Her voice divine the chief with joyful mind<br> Obey’d; and rested, on his lance reclined<br> While like Deiphobus the martial dame<br> (Her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),<br> In show an aid, by hapless Hector’s side<br> Approach’d,
            and greets him thus with voice belied:

        <p class="verse">
            “Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight<br> Of this distress, and sorrow’d in thy flight:<br> It fits us now a noble stand to make,<br> And here, as brothers, equal fates partake.”

            Then he: “O prince! allied in blood and fame,<br> Dearer than all that own a brother’s name;<br> Of all that Hecuba to Priam bore,<br> Long tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!<br> Since you, of all our numerous race alone<br>            Defend my life, regardless of your own.”

            Again the goddess: “Much my father’s prayer,<br> And much my mother’s, press’d me to forbear:<br> My friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,<br> But stronger love impell’d, and I obey.<br> Come then, the glorious conflict let us try,<br>            Let the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;<br> Or let us stretch Achilles on the field,<br> Or to his arm our bloody trophies yield.”

        <p class="letter">
            Achilles and the Myrmidons do honours to the body of Patroclus. After the funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep, the ghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of burial; the next morning the soldiers are sent
            with mules and waggons to fetch wood for the pyre. The funeral procession, and the offering their hair to the dead. Achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly twelve Trojan captives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He pays libations
            to the Winds, which (at the instance of Iris) rise, and raise the flames. When the pile has burned all night, they gather the bones, place them in an urn of gold, and raise the tomb. Achilles institutes the funeral games: the chariot-race,
            the fight of the caestus, the wrestling, the foot-race, the single combat, the discus, the shooting with arrows, the darting the javelin: the various descriptions of which, and the various success of the several antagonists, make the greatest
            part of the book.
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this book ends the thirtieth day. The night following, the ghost of Patroclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-thirtieth day is employed in felling the timber for the pile: the two-and-thirtieth in burning it;
            and the three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene is generally on the sea-shore.

            “All hail, Patroclus! let thy honour’d ghost<br> Hear, and rejoice on Pluto’s dreary coast;<br> Behold! Achilles’ promise is complete;<br> The bloody Hector stretch’d before thy feet.<br> Lo! to the dogs his carcase I resign;<br> And twelve

            march the heavy mules, securely slow,<br> O’er hills, o’er dales, o’er crags, o’er rocks they go:<a href="#fn285" name="fnref285"><sup>[285]</sup></a><br> Jumping, high o’er the shrubs of the rough ground,<br> Rattle the clattering cars, and

            return.
            <br> The sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore<br> (Such charge was given them) to the sandy shore;<br> There on the spot which great Achilles show’d,<br> They eased their shoulders, and disposed the load;<br> Circling around the place, where

        <p class="verse">
            Nor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies,<br> Smokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise;<br> But, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer,<br> Invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,<br> And victims promised, and libations cast,<br>            To gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:<br> He call’d the aerial powers, along the skies<br> To breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.<br> The winged Iris heard the hero’s call,<br> And instant hasten’d to their airy hall,<br> Where in
            old Zephyr’s open courts on high,<br> Sat all the blustering brethren of the sky.<br> She shone amidst them, on her painted bow;<br> The rocky pavement glitter’d with the show.<br> All from the banquet rise, and each invites<br> The various
            goddess to partake the rites.<br> “Not so (the dame replied), I haste to go<br> To sacred Ocean, and the floods below:<br> Even now our solemn hecatombs attend,<br> And heaven is feasting on the world’s green end<br> With righteous Ethiops
            (uncorrupted train!)<br> Far on the extremest limits of the main.<br> But Peleus’ son entreats, with sacrifice,<br> The western spirit, and the north, to rise!<br> Let on Patroclus’ pile your blast be driven,<br> And bear the blazing honours
            high to heaven.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Swift as the word she vanish’d from their view;<br> Swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew;<br> Forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,<br> And heaps on heaps the clouds are toss’d before.<br> To the wide main then stooping
            from the skies,<br> The heaving deeps in watery mountains rise:<br> Troy feels the blast along her shaking walls,<br> Till on the pile the gather’d tempest falls.<br> The structure crackles in the roaring fires,<br> And all the night the plenteous
            flame aspires.<br> All night Achilles hails Patroclus’ soul,<br> With large libations from the golden bowl.<br> As a poor father, helpless and undone,<br> Mourns o’er the ashes of an only son,<br> Takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,<br>            And pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn:<br> So stay’d Achilles, circling round the shore,<br> So watch’d the flames, till now they flame no more.<br> ’Twas when, emerging through the shades of night,<br> The morning planet told the
            approach of light;<br> And, fast behind, Aurora’s warmer ray<br> O’er the broad ocean pour’d the golden day:<br> Then sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn’d,<br> And to their caves the whistling winds return’d:<br> Across the Thracian seas
            their course they bore;<br> The ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Then parting from the pile he ceased to weep,<br> And sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,<br> Exhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd<br> Of thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;<br> The tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook<br>            Unwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name!<br> First let us quench the yet remaining flame<br> With sable wine; then, as the rites direct,<br> The hero’s bones with careful view select:<br> (Apart, and easy to be known they lie<br> Amidst
            the heap, and obvious to the eye:<br> The rest around the margin will be seen<br> Promiscuous, steeds and immolated men:)<br> These wrapp’d in double cauls of fat, prepare;<br> And in the golden vase dispose with care;<br> There let them rest
            with decent honour laid,<br> Till I shall follow to the infernal shade.<br> Meantime erect the tomb with pious hands,<br> A common structure on the humble sands:<br> Hereafter Greece some nobler work may raise,<br> And late posterity record
            our praise!”

        <p class="verse">
            The Greeks obey; where yet the embers glow,<br> Wide o’er the pile the sable wine they throw,<br> And deep subsides the ashy heap below.<br> Next the white bones his sad companions place,<br> With tears collected, in the golden vase.<br> The
            sacred relics to the tent they bore;<br> The urn a veil of linen covered o’er.<br> That done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,<br> And cast the deep foundations round the pyre;<br> High in the midst they heap the swelling bed<br> Of rising earth,

        <p class="verse">
            The swarming populace the chief detains,<br> And leads amidst a wide extent of plains;<br> There placed them round: then from the ships proceeds<br> A train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,<br> Vases and tripods (for the funeral games),<br>            Resplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.<br> First stood the prizes to reward the force<br> Of rapid racers in the dusty course:<br> A woman for the first, in beauty’s bloom,<br> Skill’d in the needle, and the labouring loom;<br> And
            a large vase, where two bright handles rise,<br> Of twenty measures its capacious size.<br> The second victor claims a mare unbroke,<br> Big with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:<br> The third, a charger yet untouch’d by flame;<br> Four ample
            measures held the shining frame:<br> Two golden talents for the fourth were placed:<br> An ample double bowl contents the last.<br> These in fair order ranged upon the plain,<br> The hero, rising, thus address’d the train:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed<br> To the brave rulers of the racing steed;<br> Prizes which none beside ourself could gain,<br> Should our immortal coursers take the plain;<br> (A race unrivall’d, which from ocean’s god<br> Peleus
            received, and on his son bestow’d.)<br> But this no time our vigour to display;<br> Nor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:<br> Lost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck<br> Their flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.<br> Sad,
            as they shared in human grief, they stand,<br> And trail those graceful honours on the sand!<br> Let others for the noble task prepare,<br> Who trust the courser and the flying car.”

            Fired at his word the rival racers rise;<br> But far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,<br> Famed though Pieria for the fleetest breed,<br> And skill’d to manage the high-bounding steed.<br> With equal ardour bold Tydides swell’d,<br> The
            steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compell’d<br> (Which late obey’d the Dardan chief’s command,<br> When scarce a god redeem’d him from his hand).<br> Then Menelaus his Podargus brings,<br> And the famed courser of the king of kings:<br> Whom
            rich Echepolus (more rich than brave),<br> To ’scape the wars, to Agamemnon gave,<br> (Æthe her name) at home to end his days;<br> Base wealth preferring to eternal praise.<br> Next him Antilochus demands the course<br> With beating heart,
            and cheers his Pylian horse.<br> Experienced Nestor gives his son the reins,<br> Directs his judgment, and his heat restrains;<br> Nor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears<br> The prudent son with unattending ears.

            “My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,<br> The gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless’d;<br> Neptune and Jove on thee conferr’d the skill<br> Swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.<br> To guide thy conduct little

            give him all the reins;<br> While thy strict hand his fellow’s head restrains,<br> And turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,<br> The wheel’s round naves appear to brush the goal.<br> Yet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)<br>            Clear of the stony heap direct the course;<br> Lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be<br> A joy to others, a reproach to me.<br> So shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,<br> And leave unskilful swiftness far behind:<br> Though thy
            fierce rival drove the matchless steed<br> Which bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;<br> Or the famed race, through all the regions known,<br> That whirl’d the car of proud Laomedon.”

        <p class="verse">
            Thus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage<br> Concludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.<br> Next bold Meriones was seen to rise,<br> The last, but not least ardent for the prize.<br> They mount their seats; the lots their place dispose<br>            (Roll’d in his helmet, these Achilles throws).<br> Young Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;<br> And next the brother of the king of men:<br> Thy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;<br> And, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.<br> They stand
            in order, an impatient train:<br> Pelides points the barrier on the plain,<br> And sends before old Phœnix to the place,<br> To mark the racers, and to judge the race.<br> At once the coursers from the barrier bound;<br> The lifted scourges
            all at once resound;<br> Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;<br> And up the champaign thunder from the shore:<br> Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,<br> And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;<br> Loose
            on their shoulders the long manes reclined,<br> Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:<br> The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,<br> Now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.<br> While hot for fame, and conquest all their
            care,
            <br> (Each o’er his flying courser hung in air,)<br> Erect with ardour, poised upon the rein,<br> They pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.<br> Now (the last compass fetch’d around the goal)<br> At the near prize each gathers all
            his soul,<br> Each burns with double hope, with double pain,<br> Tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.<br> First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;<br> With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:<br> Close on Eumelus’ back they puff
            the wind,<br> And seem just mounting on his car behind;<br> Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,<br> And, hovering o’er, their stretching shadows sees.<br> Then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;<br> But angry Phœbus to Tydides
            flies,
            <br> Strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain<br> His matchless horses’ labour on the plain.<br> Rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey<br> Snatch’d from his hope the glories of the day.<br> The fraud celestial Pallas sees with
            pain,
            <br> Springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again,<br> And fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke<br> She breaks his rival’s chariot from the yoke:<br> No more their way the startled horses held;<br> The car reversed came rattling
            on the field;<br> Shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,<br> Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell;<br> His batter’d face and elbows strike the ground;<br> Nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish’d wound:<br> Grief stops his

        <p class="verse">
            The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;<br> While thus young Nestor animates his steeds:<br> “Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;<br> Not that we hope to match Tydides’ horse,<br> Since great Minerva wings their rapid way,<br>            And gives their lord the honours of the day;<br> But reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo<br> Your swiftness? vanquish’d by a female foe?<br> Through your neglect, if lagging on the plain<br> The last ignoble gift be all we gain,<br> No more

            youth! ungenerous and unwise!<br> Go, but expect not I’ll the prize resign;<br> Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine—”<br> Then to his steeds with all his force he cries,<br> “Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!<br> Your rivals,

            Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld<br> The coursers bounding o’er the dusty field.<br> The first who mark’d them was the Cretan king;<br> High on a rising ground, above the ring,<br> The monarch sat: from whence with sure survey<br> He
            well observed the chief who led the way,<br> And heard from far his animating cries,<br> And saw the foremost steed with sharpen’d eyes;<br> On whose broad front a blaze of shining white,<br> Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.<br>            He saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:<br> “Are yonder horse discern’d by me alone?<br> Or can ye, all, another chief survey,<br> And other steeds than lately led the way?<br> Those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,<br> Lie sure
            disabled in the middle field:<br> For, since the goal they doubled, round the plain<br> I search to find them, but I search in vain.<br> Perchance the reins forsook the driver’s hand,<br> And, turn’d too short, he tumbled on the strand,<br>            Shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray<br> With frantic fury from the destined way.<br> Rise then some other, and inform my sight,<br> For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;<br> Yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,<br>            The great Ætolian chief, renown’d in war.”

        <p class="verse">
            “Old man! (Oileus rashly thus replies)<br> Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;<br> Of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,<br> Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.<br> Eumelus’ steeds, high bounding in the chase,<br> Still,
            as at first, unrivall’d lead the race:<br> I well discern him, as he shakes the rein,<br> And hear his shouts victorious o’er the plain.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin’d:<br> “Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!<br> Contentious prince, of all the Greeks beside<br> The last in merit, as the first in pride!<br> To vile reproach what answer can we make?<br> A goblet
            or a tripod let us stake,<br> And be the king the judge. The most unwise<br> Will learn their rashness, when they pay the price.”

            He said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,<br> Stern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn<br> To fell extremes. But Thetis’ godlike son<br> Awful amidst them rose, and thus begun:

        <p class="verse">
            “Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;<br> Much would ye blame, should others thus offend:<br> And lo! the approaching steeds your contest end.”<br> No sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,<br> Drives, through a stream of dust, the
            charioteer.
            <br> High o’er his head the circling lash he wields:<br> His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:<br> His car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll’d,<br> Bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,<br> Refulgent through the cloud: no eye
            could find<br> The track his flying wheels had left behind:<br> And the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace<br> So swift, it seem’d a flight, and not a race.<br> Now victor at the goal Tydides stands,<br> Quits his bright car, and springs
            upon the sands;<br> From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;<br> The well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:<br> With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,<br> The tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:<br> These to the ships

            “Behold! the man whose matchless art surpass’d<br> The sons of Greece! the ablest, yet the last!<br> Fortune denies, but justice bids us pay<br> (Since great Tydides bears the first away)<br> To him the second honours of the day.”

        <p class="verse">
            The Greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,<br> And then Eumelus had received the prize,<br> But youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame,<br> The award opposes, and asserts his claim.<br> “Think not (he cries) I tamely will resign,<br> O Peleus’

        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;<br> Pleased with the well-turn’d flattery of a friend,<br> Achilles smiled: “The gift proposed (he cried),<br> Antilochus! we shall ourself provide.<br> With plates of brass the corslet cover’d
            o’er,
            <br> (The same renown’d Asteropaeus wore,)<br> Whose glittering margins raised with silver shine,<br> (No vulgar gift,) Eumelus! shall be thine.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He said: Automedon at his command<br> The corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.<br> Distinguish’d by his friend, his bosom glows<br> With generous joy: then Menelaus rose;<br> The herald placed the sceptre in his hands,<br> And still’d
            the clamour of the shouting bands.<br> Not without cause incensed at Nestor’s son,<br> And inly grieving, thus the king begun:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “The praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain’d,<br> An act so rash, Antilochus! has stain’d.<br> Robb’d of my glory and my just reward,<br> To you, O Grecians! be my wrong declared:<br> So not a leader shall our conduct blame,<br> Or judge me
            envious of a rival’s fame.<br> But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?<br> What needs appealing in a fact so plain?<br> What Greek shall blame me, if I bid thee rise,<br> And vindicate by oath th’ ill-gotten prize?<br> Rise if thou
            darest, before thy chariot stand,<br> The driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;<br> And touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent<br> Was but to conquer, not to circumvent.<br> Swear by that god whose liquid arms surround<br> The globe,
            and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The prudent chief with calm attention heard;<br> Then mildly thus: “Excuse, if youth have err’d;<br> Superior as thou art, forgive the offence,<br> Nor I thy equal, or in years, or sense.<br> Thou know’st the errors of unripen’d age,<br> Weak
            are its counsels, headlong is its rage.<br> The prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign;<br> The mare, or aught thou ask’st, be freely thine<br> Ere I become (from thy dear friendship torn)<br> Hateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            So spoke Antilochus; and at the word<br> The mare contested to the king restored.<br> Joy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain<br> Lifts the green ear above the springing plain,<br> The fields their vegetable life renew,<br> And laugh
            and glitter with the morning dew;<br> Such joy the Spartan’s shining face o’erspread,<br> And lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:

            alike, for me, the sire and son<br> Have greatly suffer’d, and have greatly done.<br> I yield; that all may know, my soul can bend,<br> Nor is my pride preferr’d before my friend.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He said; and pleased his passion to command,<br> Resign’d the courser to Noemon’s hand,<br> Friend of the youthful chief: himself content,<br> The shining charger to his vessel sent.<br> The golden talents Merion next obtain’d;<br> The fifth
            reward, the double bowl, remain’d.<br> Achilles this to reverend Nestor bears.<br> And thus the purpose of his gift declares:<br> “Accept thou this, O sacred sire! (he said)<br> In dear memorial of Patroclus dead;<br> Dead and for ever lost

            on the field:<br> Thy pristine vigour age has overthrown,<br> But left the glory of the past thy own.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            He said, and placed the goblet at his side;<br> With joy the venerable king replied:

            The prizes next are order’d to the field,<br> For the bold champions who the caestus wield.<br> A stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,<br> Of six years’ age, unconscious of the yoke,<br> Is to the circus led, and firmly bound;<br> Next stands

            And now succeed the gifts ordain’d to grace<br> The youths contending in the rapid race:<br> A silver urn that full six measures held,<br> By none in weight or workmanship excell’d:<br> Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,<br> Elaborate,
            with artifice divine;<br> Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,<br> And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:<br> From him descended, good Eunaeus heir’d<br> The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,<br> To brave Patroclus gave the
            rich reward:<br> Now, the same hero’s funeral rites to grace,<br> It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.<br> A well-fed ox was for the second placed;<br> And half a talent must content the last.<br> Achilles rising then bespoke the
            train:

            the barrier with his hand;<br> All start at once; Oileus led the race;<br> The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;<br> Behind him, diligently close, he sped,<br> As closely following as the running thread<br> The spindle follows, and displays
            the charms<br> Of the fair spinster’s breast and moving arms:<br> Graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,<br> And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;<br> His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:<br> The admiring Greeks loud

            thus in thought he pray’d!<br> And present at his thought descends the maid.<br> Buoy’d by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,<br> And feels a pinion lifting every limb.<br> All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,<br> Unhappy Ajax stumbles
            on the plain<br> (O’erturn’d by Pallas), where the slippery shore<br> Was clogg’d with slimy dung and mingled gore.<br> (The self-same place beside Patroclus’ pyre,<br> Where late the slaughter’d victims fed the fire.)<br> Besmear’d with filth,
            and blotted o’er with clay,<br> Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;<br> The well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,<br> And left the urn Ulysses’ rich reward.<br> Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,<br> The baffled hero thus
            the Greeks address’d:

        <p class="verse">
            “Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;<br> A mortal I, a goddess was my foe;<br> She urged her favourite on the rapid way,<br> And Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            Thus sourly wail’d he, sputtering dirt and gore;<br> A burst of laughter echoed through the shore.<br> Antilochus, more humorous than the rest,<br> Takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            “Why with our wiser elders should we strive?<br> The gods still love them, and they always thrive.<br> Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:<br> He to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;<br> (A green old age unconscious of decays,<br> That
            proves the hero born in better days!)<br> Behold his vigour in this active race!<br> Achilles only boasts a swifter pace:<br> For who can match Achilles? He who can,<br> Must yet be more than hero, more than man.”
        </p>

        <p class="verse">
            The effect succeeds the speech.

The host admire<br>            The son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.

            THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR.
        </p>

        <p class="letter">
            The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector’s body. Jupiter sends Thetis to Achilles, to dispose him for the restoring it, and Iris to Priam, to encourage him to go in person and treat for it. The old king, notwithstanding the remonstrances of
            his queen, makes ready for the journey, to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter. He sets forth in his chariot, with a waggon loaded with presents, under the charge of Idaeus the herald. Mercury descends in the shape of a young man,
            and conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. Their conversation on the way. Priam finds Achilles at his table, casts himself at his feet, and begs for the body of his son: Achilles, moved with compassion, grants his request, detains him one
            night in his tent, and the next morning sends him home with the body: the Trojans run out to meet him. The lamentations of Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen, with the solemnities of the funeral.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time
            of twelve days is employed in this book, while the body of Hector lies in the tent of Achilles; and as many more are spent in the truce allowed for his interment. The scene is partly in Achilles’ camp, and partly in Troy.

            Now from the finish’d games the Grecian band<br> Seek their black ships, and clear the crowded strand,<br> All stretch’d at ease the genial banquet share,<br> And pleasing slumbers quiet all their care.<br> Not so Achilles: he, to grief resign’d,<br>            His friend’s dear image present to his mind,<br> Takes his sad couch, more unobserved to weep;<br> Nor tastes the gifts of all-composing sleep.<br> Restless he roll’d around his weary bed,<br> And all his soul on his Patroclus fed:<br> The

            Hector dragg’d, then hurried to the tent.<br> There sleep at last o’ercomes the hero’s eyes;<br> While foul in dust the unhonour’d carcase lies,<br> But not deserted by the pitying skies:<br> For Phœbus watch’d it with superior care,<br> Preserved
            from gaping wounds and tainting air;<br> And, ignominious as it swept the field,<br> Spread o’er the sacred corse his golden shield.<br> All heaven was moved, and Hermes will’d to go<br> By stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe:
            <br> But Neptune this, and Pallas this denies,<br> And th’ unrelenting empress of the skies,<br> E’er since that day implacable to Troy,<br> What time young Paris, simple shepherd boy,<br> Won by destructive lust (reward obscene),<br> Their

            above
            <br> In Hector’s cause have moved the ear of Jove;<br> ’Twas voted, Hermes from his godlike foe<br> By stealth should bear him, but we will’d not so:<br> We will, thy son himself the corse restore,<br> And to his conquest add this glory more.
            <br> Then hie thee to him, and our mandate bear:<br> Tell him he tempts the wrath of heaven too far;<br> Nor let him more (our anger if he dread)<br> Vent his mad vengeance on the sacred dead;<br> But yield to ransom and the father’s prayer;

            His word the silver-footed queen attends,<br> And from Olympus’ snowy tops descends.<br> Arrived, she heard the voice of loud lament,<br> And echoing groans that shook the lofty tent:<br> His friends prepare the victim, and dispose<br> Repast

Jove himself (for Jove’s command I bear)<br> Forbids to tempt the wrath of heaven too far.<br> No longer then (his fury if thou dread)<br> Detain the relics of great Hector dead;<br> Nor

            “Such griefs, O king! have other parents known;<br> Remember theirs, and mitigate thy own.<br> The care of heaven thy Hector has appear’d,<br> Nor shall he lie unwept, and uninterr’d;<br> Soon may thy aged cheeks in tears be drown’d,<br> And

            <a name="chap25"></a>CONCLUDING NOTE.</h2>

        <p>
            We have now passed through the Iliad, and seen the anger of Achilles, and the terrible effects of it, at an end: as that only was the subject of the poem, and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author to proceed to the event of the war, it
            perhaps may be acceptable to the common reader to give a short account of what happened to Troy and the chief actors in this poem after the conclusion of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            I need not mention that Troy was taken soon after the death of Hector by the stratagem of the wooden horse, the particulars of which are described by Virgil in the second book of the Æneid.
        </p>

        <p>
            Achilles fell before Troy, by the hand of Paris, by the shot of an arrow in his heel, as Hector had prophesied at his death, lib. xxii.
        </p>

        <p>
            The unfortunate Priam was killed by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ajax, after the death of Achilles, had a contest with Ulysses for the armour of Vulcan, but being defeated in his aim, he slew himself through indignation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Helen, after the death of Paris, married Deiphobus his brother, and at the taking of Troy betrayed him, in order to reconcile herself to Menelaus her first husband, who received her again into favour.
        </p>

        <p>
            Agamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by Ægysthus, at the instigation of Clytemnestra his wife, who in his absence had dishonoured his bed with Ægysthus.
        </p>

        <p>
            Diomed, after the fall of Troy, was expelled his own country, and scarce escaped with his life from his adulterous wife Ægialé; but at last was received by Daunus in Apulia, and shared his kingdom; it is uncertain how he died.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nestor lived in peace with his children, in Pylos, his native country.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ulysses also, after innumerable troubles by sea and land, at last returned in safety to Ithaca, which is the subject of Homer’s Odyssey.
        </p>

        <p>
            For what remains, I beg to be excused from the ceremonies of taking leave at the end of my work, and from embarrassing myself, or others, with any defences or apologies about it. But instead of endeavouring to raise a vain monument to myself, of the merits
            or difficulties of it (which must be left to the world, to truth, and to posterity), let me leave behind me a memorial of my friendship with one of the most valuable of men, as well as finest writers, of my age and country, one who has tried,
            and knows by his own experience, how hard an undertaking it is to do justice to Homer, and one whom (I am sure) sincerely rejoices with me at the period of my labours. To him, therefore, having brought this long work to a conclusion, I desire
            to dedicate it, and to have the honour and satisfaction of placing together, in this manner, the names of Mr. C<small>ONGREVE</small>, and of

            the song when begun. His voice probably preserved a medium between singing and recitation; the words, and not the melody were regarded by the listeners, hence it was necessary for him to remain intelligible to all. In countries where nothing
            similar is found, it is difficult to represent such scenes to the mind; but whoever has had an opportunity of listening to the improvisation of Italy, can easily form an idea of Demodocus and Phemius.”—<i>Ancient

            at Delos, where Latona gave birth to Apollo. This passage is referred to by Stephanus of Byzantium, <i>s. v.</i> N. T. p. 490, ed. de Pinedo. I omit quoting any of the dull epigrams ascribed to Homer for, as Mr. Justice Talfourd rightly observes,

            <a name="fn25"></a> <a href="#fnref25">[25]</a> It is, indeed not easy to calculate the height to which the memory may be cultivated. To take an ordinary case, we might refer to that of any first rate actor, who must be prepared, at a very short warning,
            to ‘rhapsodize,’ night after night, parts which when laid together, would amount to an immense number of lines. But all this is nothing to two instances of our own day. Visiting at Naples a gentleman of the highest intellectual attainments,
            and who held a distinguished rank among the men of letters in the last century, he informed us that the day before he had passed much time in examining a man, not highly educated, who had learned to repeat the whole Gierusalemme of Tasso,
            not only to recite it consecutively, but also to repeat those stanzas in utter defiance of the sense, either forwards or backwards, or from the eighth line to the first, alternately the odd and even lines—in short, whatever the passage required;
            the memory, which seemed to cling to the words much more than to the sense, had it at such perfect command, that it could produce it under any form. Our informant went on to state that this singular being was proceeding to learn the Orlando
            Furioso in the same manner. But even this instance is less wonderful than one as to which we may appeal to any of our readers that happened some twenty years ago to visit the town of Stirling, in Scotland. No such person can have forgotten
            the poor, uneducated man Blind Jamie who could actually repeat, after a few minutes consideration any verse required from any part of the Bible—even the obscurest and most unimportant enumeration of mere proper names not excepted. We do not
            mention these facts as touching the more difficult part of the question before us, but facts they are; and if we find so much difficulty in calculating the extent to which the mere memory may be cultivated, are we, in these days of multifarious
            reading, and of countless distracting affairs, fair judges of the perfection to which the invention and the memory combined may attain in a simpler age, and among a more single minded people?—Quarterly Review, <i>l. c.</i>, p. 143, sqq.<br>            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heeren steers between the two opinions, observing that, “The Dschungariade of the Calmucks is said to surpass the poems of Homer in length, as much as it stands beneath them in merit, and yet it exists only in the memory
            of a people which is not unacquainted with writing. But the songs of a nation are probably the last things which are committed to writing, for the very reason that they are remembered.”—

            <a name="fn40"></a> <a href="#fnref40">[40]</a> The following argument of the Iliad, corrected in a few particulars, is translated from Bitaubé, and is, perhaps, the neatest summary that has ever been drawn up:—“A hero, injured by his general, and animated
            with a noble resentment, retires to his tent; and for a season withdraws himself and his troops from the war. During this interval, victory abandons the army, which for nine years has been occupied in a great enterprise, upon the successful
            termination of which the honour of their country depends. The general, at length opening his eyes to the fault which he had committed, deputes the principal officers of his army to the incensed hero, with commission to make compensation for
            the injury, and to tender magnificent presents. The hero, according to the proud obstinacy of his character, persists in his animosity; the army is again defeated, and is on the verge of entire destruction. This inexorable man has a friend;
            this friend weeps before him, and asks for the hero’s arms, and for permission to go to the war in his stead. The eloquence of friendship prevails more than the intercession of the ambassadors or the gifts of the general. He lends his armour
            to his friend, but commands him not to engage with the chief of the enemy’s army, because he reserves to himself the honour of that combat, and because he also fears for his friend’s life. The prohibition is forgotten; the friend listens to
            nothing but his courage; his corpse is brought back to the hero, and the hero’s arms become the prize of the conqueror. Then the hero, given up to the most lively despair, prepares to fight; he receives from a divinity new armour, is reconciled
            with his general and, thirsting for glory and revenge, enacts prodigies of valour, recovers the victory, slays the enemy’s chief, honours his friend with superb funeral rites, and exercises a cruel vengeance on the body of his destroyer; but
            finally appeased by the tears and prayers of the father of the slain warrior, restores to the old man the corpse of his son, which he buries with due solemnities.’—Coleridge, p. 177, sqq.

            <i>Smintheus</i> an epithet taken from sminthos, the Phrygian name for a
            <i>mouse</i>, was applied to Apollo for having put an end to a plague of mice which had harassed that territory. Strabo, however, says, that when the Teucri were migrating from Crete, they were told by an oracle to settle in that place, where
            they should not be attacked by the original inhabitants of the land, and that, having halted for the night, a number of field-mice came and gnawed away the leathern straps of their baggage, and thongs of their armour. In fulfilment of the
            oracle, they settled on the spot, and raised a temple to Sminthean Apollo. Grote, “History of Greece,” i. p. 68, remarks that the “worship of Sminthean Apollo, in various parts of the Troad and its neighboring territory, dates before the earliest

            <i>Bent was his bow</i> “The Apollo of Homer, it must be borne in mind, is a different character from the deity of the same name in the later classical pantheon. Throughout both poems, all deaths from unforeseen or invisible causes, the ravages
            of pestilence, the fate of the young child or promising adult, cut off in the germ of infancy or flower of youth, of the old man dropping peacefully into the grave, or of the reckless sinner suddenly checked in his career of crime, are ascribed
            to the arrows of Apollo or Diana. The oracular functions of the god rose naturally out of the above fundamental attributes, for who could more appropriately impart to mortals what little foreknowledge Fate permitted of her decrees than the
            agent of her most awful dispensations? The close union of the arts of prophecy and song explains his additional office of god of music, while the arrows with which he and his sister were armed, symbols of sudden death in every age, no less
            naturally procured him that of god of archery. Of any connection between Apollo and the Sun, whatever may have existed in the more esoteric doctrine of the Greek sanctuaries, there is no trace in either Iliad or Odyssey.”—Mure, “History of

            origin of Thebes, and of the worship of Jupiter Ammon. “I think,” says Heeren, after quoting a passage from Diodorus about the holy ship, “that this procession is represented in one of the great sculptured reliefs on the temple of Karnak.
            The sacred ship of Ammon is on the shore with its whole equipment, and is towed along by another boat. It is therefore on its voyage. This must have been one of the most celebrated festivals, since, even according to the interpretation of
            antiquity, Homer alludes to it when he speaks of Jupiter’s visit to the Ethiopians, and his twelve days’ absence.”—Long, “Egyptian Antiquities” vol. 1 p. 96. Eustathius, vol. 1 p. 98, sq. (ed. Basil) gives this interpretation, and likewise

            <a name="fn87"></a> <a href="#fnref87">[87]</a> It may be remarked, that the character of Thersites, revolting and contemptible as it is, serves admirably to develop the disposition of Ulysses in a new light, in which mere cunning is less prominent. Of the
            gradual and individual development of Homer’s heroes, Schlegel well observes, “In bas-relief the figures are usually in profile, and in the epos all are characterized in the simplest manner in relief; they are not grouped together, but follow
            one another; so Homer’s heroes advance, one by one, in succession before us. It has been remarked that the <i>Iliad</i> is not definitively closed, but that we are left to suppose something both to precede and to follow it. The bas-relief
            is equally without limit, and may be continued
            <i>ad infinitum</i>, either from before or behind, on which account the ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite extension, sacrificial processions, dances, and lines of combatants, and hence they also exhibit bas-reliefs
            on curved surfaces, such as vases, or the frieze of a rotunda, where, by the curvature, the two ends are withdrawn from our sight, and where, while we advance, one object appears as another disappears. Reading Homer is very much like such
            a circuit; the present object alone arresting our attention, we lose sight of what precedes, and do not concern ourselves about what is to follow.”—“Dramatic Literature,” p. 75.

            a character is attested even more by the excessive pains which Homer takes to heap upon him repulsive personal deformities, than by the chastisement of Odysseus he is lame, bald, crook-backed, of misshapen head, and squinting vision.”—Grote,

            The goat to Bacchus, because he fed on vines. Diana was propitiated with a stag; and to Venus the dove was consecrated. The infernal and evil deities were to be appeased with black victims. The most acceptable of all sacrifices was the heifer

            <i>Scamander</i>, or Scamandros, was a river of Troas, rising, according to Strabo, on the highest part of Mount Ida, in the same hill with the Granicus and the OEdipus, and falling into the sea at Sigaeum; everything tends to identify it
            with Mendere, as Wood, Rennell, and others maintain; the Mendere is 40 miles long, 300 feet broad, deep in the time of flood, nearly dry in the summer. Dr. Clarke successfully combats the opinion of those who make the Scamander to have arisen
            from the springs of Bounabarshy, and traces the source of the river to the highest mountain in the chain of Ida, now Kusdaghy; receives the Simois in its course; towards its mouth it is very muddy, and flows through marshes. Between the Scamander
            and Simois, Homer’s Troy is supposed to have stood: this river, according to Homer, was called Xanthus by the gods, Scamander by men. The waters of the Scamander had the singular property of giving a beautiful colour to the hair or wool of
            such animals as bathed in them; hence the three goddesses, Minerva, Juno, and Venus, bathed there before they appeared before Paris to obtain the golden apple: the name Xanthus, “yellow,” was given to the Scamander, from the peculiar colour
            of its waters, still applicable to the Mendere, the yellow colour of whose waters attracts the attention of travellers.

            the Catalogue, whensoever it may have taken place, necessarily presumes its author’s acquaintance with a previously existing Iliad. It were impossible otherwise to account for the harmony observable in the recurrence of so vast a number of
            proper names, most of them historically unimportant, and not a few altogether fictitious: or of so many geographical and genealogical details as are condensed in these few hundred lines, and incidentally scattered over the thousands which
            follow: equally inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring in this episode to events narrated in the previous and subsequent text, several of which could hardly be of traditional notoriety, but through the medium of the Iliad.”—Mure,
            “Language and Literature of Greece,” vol. i. p. 263.

            <i>Twice Sixty:</i> “Thucydides observes that the Bœotian vessels, which carried one hundred and twenty men each, were probably meant to be the largest in the fleet, and those of Philoctetes, carrying fifty each, the smallest. The average
            would be eighty-five, and Thucydides supposes the troops to have rowed and navigated themselves; and that very few, besides the chiefs, went as mere passengers or landsmen. In short, we have in the Homeric descriptions the complete picture
            of an Indian or African war canoe, many of which are considerably larger than the largest scale assigned to those of the Greeks. If the total number of the Greek ships be taken at twelve hundred, according to Thucydides, although in point
            of fact there are only eleven hundred and eighty-six in the Catalogue, the amount of the army, upon the foregoing average, will be about a hundred and two thousand men. The historian considers this a small force as representing all Greece.
            Bryant, comparing it with the allied army at Platae, thinks it so large as to prove the entire falsehood of the whole story; and his reasonings and calculations are, for their curiosity, well worth a careful perusal.”—Coleridge, p. 211, sq.

            from men, permitting only a short temporary intercourse, for the purpose of renovating their numbers, burning out their right breast with a view of enabling themselves to draw the bow freely; this was at once a general type, stimulating to
            the fancy of the poet, and a theme eminently popular with his hearers. We find these warlike females constantly reappearing in the ancient poems, and universally accepted as past realities in the Iliad. When Priam wishes to illustrate emphatically
            the most numerous host in which he ever found himself included, he tells us that it was assembled in Phrygia, on the banks of the Sangarius, for the purpose of resisting the formidable Amazons. When Bellerophon is to be employed in a deadly
            and perilous undertaking, by those who prudently wished to procure his death, he is despatched against the Amazons.—Grote, vol. i p. 289.

            prisoners alive, with a scantling of food by their side. Though Homer makes no mention of this horrible usage, the example of the Roman Vestals affords reasons for believing that, in ascribing it to the heroic ages, Sophocles followed an authentic

            rather than elegance, that he means to commend, in speaking of the fair house which Paris had built for himself with the aid of the most skilful masons of Troy.”—Thirlwall’s Greece, vol. i. p. 231.

            camp and fleet unfortified during nine years, in the midst of a hostile country, is a purely poetical one: ‘So long as Achilles fought, the terror of his name sufficed to keep every foe at a distance.’ The disasters consequent on his secession
            first led to the necessity of other means of protection. Accordingly, in the battles previous to the eighth book, no allusion occurs to a rampart; in all those which follow it forms a prominent feature. Here, then, in the anomaly as in the
            propriety of the Iliad, the destiny of Achilles, or rather this peculiar crisis of it, forms the pervading bond of connexion to the whole poem.”—Mure, vol. i., p. 257.

            <a name="fn201"></a> <a href="#fnref201">[201]</a> In the heroic times, it is not unfrequent for the king to receive presents to purchase freedom from his wrath, or immunity from his exactions. Such gifts gradually became regular, and formed the income of
            the German, (Tacit. Germ. Section 15) Persian, (Herodot. iii.89), and other kings. So, too, in the middle ages, ‘The feudal aids are the beginning of taxation, of which they for a long time answered the purpose.’ (Hallam, Middle Ages, ch.
            x. pt. 1, p. 189) This fact frees Achilles from the apparent charge of sordidness. Plato, however, (De Rep. vi. 4), says, “We cannot commend Phœnix, the tutor of Achilles, as if he spoke correctly, when counselling him to accept of presents
            and assist the Greeks, but, without presents, not to desist from his wrath, nor again, should we commend Achilles himself, or approve of his being so covetous as to receive presents from Agamemnon,” &amp;c.

            rich and fertile. But when the channels came to be either neglected, or designedly choked up by an enemy, the water accumulated in such a degree as to occupy the soil of more than one ancient islet, and to occasion the change of the site of

            in traditions which, if not of equal antiquity, were grounded on the same feeling, seem to have but one heart and soul, with scarcely a wish or object apart, and only to live as they are always ready to die for one another. It is true that
            the relation between them is not always one of perfect equality; but this is a circumstance which, while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical description, detracts little from the dignity of the idea which it presents. Such were
            the friendships of Hercules and Iolaus, of Theseus and Pirithous, of Orestes and Pylades; and though These may owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even dramatic poetry, the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the
            period to which the traditions are referred. The argument of the Iliad mainly turns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus, whose love for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for his higher birth and his unequalled prowess.
            But the mutual regard which united Idomeneus and Meriones, Diomedes and Sthenelus, though, as the persons themselves are less important, it is kept more in the back-ground, is manifestly viewed by the poet in the same light. The idea of a
            Greek hero seems not to have been thought complete, without such a brother in arms by his side.”—Thirlwall, Greece, vol. i. p. 176, seq.

            <i>The destinies ordain</i>.—“In the mythology, also, of the Iliad, purely Pagan as it is, we discover one important truth unconsciously involved, which was almost entirely lost from view amidst the nearly equal scepticism and credulity of
            subsequent ages. Zeus or Jupiter is popularly to be taken as omnipotent. No distinct empire is assigned to fate or fortune; the will of the father of gods and men is absolute and uncontrollable. This seems to be the true character of the Homeric
            deity, and it is very necessary that the student of Greek literature should bear it constantly in mind. A strong instance in the Iliad itself to illustrate this position, is the passage where Jupiter laments to Juno the approaching death of
            Sarpedon. ‘Alas me!’ says he ‘since it is fated (moira) that Sarpedon, dearest to me of men, should be slain by Patroclus, the son of Menoetius! Indeed, my heart is divided within me while I ruminate it in my mind, whether having snatched
            him up from out of the lamentable battle, I should not at once place him alive in the fertile land of his own Lycia, or whether I should now destroy him by the hands of the son of Menoetius!’ To which Juno answers—‘Dost thou mean to rescue
            from death a mortal man, long since destined by fate (palai pepromenon)? You may do it—but we, the rest of the gods, do not sanction it.’ Here it is clear from both speakers, that although Sarpedon is said to be fated to die, Jupiter might
            still, if he pleased, save him, and place him entirely out of the reach of any such event, and further, in the alternative, that Jupiter himself would destroy him by the hands of another.”—Coleridge, p. 156. seq.

            <i>Thrice at the battlements</i>. “The art military of the Homeric age is upon a level with the state of navigation just described, personal prowess decided every thing; the night attack and the ambuscade, although much esteemed, were never
            upon a large scale. The chiefs fight in advance, and enact almost as much as the knights of romance. The siege of Troy was as little like a modern siege as a captain in the guards is like Achilles. There is no mention of a ditch or any other
            line or work round the town, and the wall itself was accessible without a ladder. It was probably a vast mound of earth with a declivity outwards. Patroclus thrice mounts it in armour. The Trojans are in no respects blockaded, and receive
            assistance from their allies to the very end.”—Coleridge, p. 212.

            little more than the names and arrangements; and the difference of arrangement in the Shield of Hercules is altogether for the worse. The natural consecution of the Homeric images needs no exposition: it constitutes in itself one of the beauties
            of the work. The Hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or congruity: Mars and Pallas are awkwardly introduced among the Centaurs and Lapithae;— but the gap is wide indeed between them and Apollo with the Muses, waking the
            echoes of Olympus to celestial harmonies; whence however, we are hurried back to Perseus, the Gorgons, and other images of war, over an arm of the sea, in which the sporting dolphins, the fugitive fishes, and the fisherman on the shore with
            his casting net, are minutely represented. As to the Hesiodic images themselves, the leading remark is, that they catch at beauty by ornament, and at sublimity by exaggeration; and upon the untenable supposition of the genuineness of this
            poem, there is this curious peculiarity, that, in the description of scenes of rustic peace, the superiority of Homer is decisive—while in those of war and tumult it may be thought, perhaps, that the Hesiodic poet has more than once the advantage.”

            dry, so as to be easily forded by the foot passenger. But a thunder-shower in the mountains, unobserved perhaps by the traveller on the plain, may suddenly immerse him in the flood of a mighty river. The rescue of Achilles by the fiery arms
            of Vulcan scarcely admits of the same ready explanation from physical causes. Yet the subsiding of the flood at the critical moment when the hero’s destruction appeared imminent, might, by a slight extension of the figurative parallel, be

            <a name="fn291"></a> <a href="#fnref291">[291]</a> Virgil, by making the boaster vanquished, has drawn a better moral from this episode than Homer. The following lines deserve comparison:—<br>
            <br> “The haughty Dares in the lists appears:<br> Walking he strides, his head erected bears:<br> His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,<br> And loud applauses echo through the field.<br> * * * *<br> Such Dares was, and such he strode
            along,
            <br> And drew the wonder of the gazing throng<br> His brawny breast and ample chest he shows;<br> His lifted arms around his head he throws,<br> And deals in whistling air his empty blows.<br> His match is sought, but, through the trembling
            band,
            <br> No one dares answer to the proud demand.<br> Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes,<br> Already he devours the promised prize.<br> * * * *<br> If none my matchless valour dares oppose,<br> How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?”
            <br>
            <br> Dryden’s Virgil, v. 486, seq.

            <a name="fn292"></a> <a href="#fnref292">[292]</a><br> “The gauntlet-fight thus ended, from the shore<br> His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:<br> His mouth and nostrils pour’d a purple flood,<br> And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.”<br>

            <a name="fn294"></a> <a href="#fnref294">[294]</a> Milton has rivalled this passage describing the descent of Gabriel, “Paradise Lost,” bk. v. 266, seq.<br>
            <br> “Down thither prone in flight<br> He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky<br> Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing,<br> Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan<br> Winnows the buxom air. * * * *<br> * * * *<br> At
            once on th’ eastern cliff of Paradise<br> He lights, and to his proper shape returns<br> A seraph wing’d. * * * *<br> Like Maia’s son he stood,<br> And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance fill’d<br> The circuit wide.”<br>
            <br> Virgil, Æn. iv. 350:—<br>
            <br> “Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds<br> His flying feet, and mounts the western winds:<br> And whether o’er the seas or earth he flies,<br> With rapid force they bear him down the skies<br> But first he grasps within his awful hand<br>            The mark of sovereign power, his magic wand;<br> With this he draws the ghost from hollow graves;<br> With this he drives them from the Stygian waves:<br> * * * *<br> Thus arm’d, the god begins his airy race,v And drives the racking clouds
            along the liquid space.”<br>
            <br> Dryden.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a name="fn295"></a> <a href="#fnref295">[295]</a> In reference to the whole scene that follows, the remarks of Coleridge are well worth reading:—
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“By a close study of life, and by a true and natural mode of expressing everything, Homer was enabled to venture upon the most peculiar and difficult situations, and to extricate himself from them with the completest
            success. The whole scene between Achilles and Priam, when the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose of redeeming the body of Hector, is at once the most profoundly skilful, and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the Iliad.
            Quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of Priam, the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent, that if genius did not often, especially in oratory, unconsciously fulfil the most subtle precepts of criticism, we might be
            induced, on this account alone, to consider the last book of the Iliad as what is called spurious, in other words, of later date than the rest of the poem. Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in occupying the mind of Achilles, from the outset,
            with the image of his father; in gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation; and, lastly, mentioning Hector’s name when he perceives that the hero is softened, and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of the conqueror.
            The ego d’eleeinoteros per, and the apusato aecha geronta, are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the Iliad. They are almost too fine and pathetic. The whole passage defies translation, for there is that about the Greek which
            has no name, but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can only be felt in the original, and is lost in an attempt to transfuse it into another language.”—Coleridge, p. 195.
        </p>

        <p class="footnote">
            <a name="fn296"></a> <a href="#fnref296">[296]</a> “Achilles’ ferocious treatment of the corpse of Hector cannot but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity. The heroic age, however, must be judged by its own moral laws. Retributive vengeance
            on the dead, as well as the living, was a duty inculcated by the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that evil inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man; but made the welfare of the soul after death
            dependent on the fate of the body from which it had separated. Hence a denial of the rites essential to the soul’s admission into the more favoured regions of the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary shores of the
            infernal river. The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus to Achilles, of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies, shows how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must have been in satiating the thirst of revenge, which,
            even after death, was supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades. Hence before yielding up the body of Hector to Priam, Achilles asks pardon of Patroclus for even this partial cession of his just rights of retribution.”—Mure, vol. i. 289.

            <a name="fn297"></a> <a href="#fnref297">[297]</a> Such was the fate of Astyanax, when Troy was taken.<br>
            <br> “Here, from the tow’r by stern Ulysses thrown,<br> Andromache bewail’d her infant son.”<br>
            <br> Merrick’s Tryphiodorus, v. 675.
        </p>

        <p class="footnote">
            <a name="fn298"></a> <a href="#fnref298">[298]</a> The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most gallant and interesting view of Helen’s character—<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand that
            has given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles, gives us also the consummate elegance and tenderness of Helen. She is through the Iliad a genuine lady, graceful in motion and speech, noble in her associations, full of remorse for a fault
            for which higher powers seem responsible, yet grateful and affectionate towards those with whom that fault had committed her. I have always thought the following speech in which Helen laments Hector, and hints at her own invidious and unprotected
            situation in Troy, as almost the sweetest passage in the poem. It is another striking instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of tone which so generally distinguish the last book of the Iliad from the rest.”—Classic Poets, p. 198,
            seq.
        </p>

        <p class="footnote">
            <a name="fn299"></a> <a href="#fnref299">[299]</a> “And here we part with Achilles at the moment best calculated to exalt and purify our impression of his character. We had accompanied him through the effervescence, undulations, and final subsidence of his
            stormy passions. We now leave him in repose and under the full influence of the more amiable affections, while our admiration of his great qualities is chastened by the reflection that, within a few short days the mighty being in whom they
            were united was himself to be suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise.
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequent and touching allusions, interspersed throughout the Iliad, to the speedy termination of its hero’s course, and the moral on the vanity of human life which they indicate, are among the finest evidences
            of the spirit of ethic unity by which the whole framework of the poem is united.”—Mure, vol. i. p 201.
        </p>

        <p class="footnote">
            <a name="fn300"></a> <a href="#fnref300">[300]</a> Cowper says,—“I cannot take my leave of this noble poem without expressing how much I am struck with the plain conclusion of it. It is like the exit of a great man out of company, whom he has entertained
            magnificently; neither pompous nor familiar; not contemptuous, yet without much ceremony.” Coleridge, p. 227, considers the termination of “Paradise Lost” somewhat similar.

        </div>

        <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
            Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and
            donations from people in all walks of life.
        </div>

        <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
            Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001,
            the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts
            and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

            Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
        </div>

        <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
            Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible
            by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.
        </div>

        <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
            The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet
            and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
            <a href="/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
        </div>

        <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
            While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.
        </div>

        <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
            International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

        <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
            Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

            Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
        </div>

        <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
            Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
            volunteer support.
        </div>

        <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
            Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular
            paper edition.
